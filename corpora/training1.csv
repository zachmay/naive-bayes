CONTEXT: Germline loss-of-function phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) mutations cause 80% of Cowden syndrome, a rare autosomal-dominant disorder (1 in 200,000 live births), characterized by high risks of breast, thyroid, and other cancers. A large heterogeneous group of individuals with Cowden-like syndrome, who have various combinations of Cowden syndrome features but who do not meet Cowden syndrome diagnostic criteria, have PTEN mutations less than 10% of the time, making molecular diagnosis, prediction, genetic counseling, and risk management challenging. Other mechanisms of loss of function such as hypermethylation, which should result in underexpression of PTEN or of KILLIN, a novel tumor suppressor transcribed in the opposite direction, may account for the remainder of Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether germline methylation is found in Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome in individuals lacking germline PTEN mutations. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nucleic acids from prospective nested series of 123 patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome and 50 unaffected individuals without PTEN variants were analyzed for germline methylation and expression of PTEN and KILLIN at the Cleveland Clinic, August 2008-June 2010. Prevalence of component cancers between groups was compared using the Fisher exact test. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of germline methylation in PTEN mutation-negative Cowden syndrome and Cowden syndrome-like individuals. Prevalence of component cancers in methylation-positive and PTEN mutation-positive individuals. RESULTS: Of 123 patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome, 45 (37%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-45%) showed hypermethylation upstream of PTEN but no transcriptional repression. The germline methylation was found to transcriptionally down-regulate KILLIN by 250-fold (95% CI, 45-14 286; P = .007) and exclusively disrupted TP53 activation of KILLIN by 30% (95% CI, 7%-45%; P = .008). Demethylation treatment increased only KILLIN expression 4.88-fold (95% CI, 1.4-18.1; P = .05). Individuals with KILLIN -promoter methylation had a 3-fold increased prevalence of breast cancer (35/42 vs 24/64; P < .0001) and a greater than 2-fold increase of kidney cancer (4/45 vs 6/155; P = .004) over individuals with germline PTEN mutations. CONCLUSIONS: Germline KILLIN methylation is common among patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome and is associated with increased risks of breast and renal cancer over PTEN mutation-positive individuals. These observations need to be replicated.",cancer"Association of a leukemic stem cell gene expression signature with clinical outcomes in acute myeloid leukemia. CONTEXT: In many cancers, specific subpopulations of cells appear to be uniquely capable of initiating and maintaining tumors. The strongest support for this cancer stem cell model comes from transplantation assays in immunodeficient mice, which indicate that human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is driven by self-renewing leukemic stem cells (LSCs). This model has significant implications for the development of novel therapies, but its clinical relevance has yet to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To identify an LSC gene expression signature and test its association with clinical outcomes in AML. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Retrospective study of global gene expression (microarray) profiles of LSC-enriched subpopulations from primary AML and normal patient samples, which were obtained at a US medical center between April 2005 and July 2007, and validation data sets of global transcriptional profiles of AML tumors from 4 independent cohorts (n = 1047). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of genes discriminating LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in AML tumors; and association of LSC-specific genes with overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival and with therapeutic response. RESULTS: Expression levels of 52 genes distinguished LSC-enriched populations from other subpopulations in cell-sorted AML samples. An LSC score summarizing expression of these genes in bulk primary AML tumor samples was associated with clinical outcomes in the 4 independent patient cohorts. High LSC scores were associated with worse overall, event-free, and relapse-free survival among patients with either normal karyotypes or chromosomal abnormalities. For the largest cohort of patients with normal karyotypes (n = 163), the LSC score was significantly associated with overall survival as a continuous variable (hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.22; log-likelihood P <.001). The absolute risk of death by 3 years was 57% (95% CI, 43%-67%) for the low LSC score group compared with 78% (95% CI, 66%-86%) for the high LSC score group (HR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.3-2.7]; log-rank P = .002). In another cohort with available data on event-free survival for 70 patients with normal karyotypes, the risk of an event by 3 years was 48% (95% CI, 27%-63%) in the low LSC score group vs 81% (95% CI, 60%-91%) in the high LSC score group (HR, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.3-4.5]; log-rank P = .006). In multivariate Cox regression including age, mutations in FLT3 and NPM1, and cytogenetic abnormalities, the HRs for LSC score in the 3 cohorts with data on all variables were 1.07 (95% CI, 1.01-1.13; P = .02), 1.10 (95% CI, 1.03-1.17; P = .005), and 1.17 (95% CI, 1.05-1.30; P = .005). CONCLUSION: High expression of an LSC gene signature is independently associated with adverse outcomes in patients with AML.",cancer"Imatinib plus peginterferon alfa-2a in chronic myeloid leukemia. BACKGROUND: Imatinib (400 mg daily) is considered the best initial therapy for patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase. However, only a minority of patients treated with imatinib have a complete molecular remission. METHODS: We randomly assigned 636 patients with untreated chronic-phase CML to receive imatinib alone at a dose of 400 mg daily, imatinib (400 mg daily) plus cytarabine (20 mg per square meter of body-surface area per day on days 15 through 28 of each 28-day cycle) or pegylated interferon (peginterferon) alfa-2a (90 mug weekly), or imatinib alone at a dose of 600 mg daily. Molecular and cytogenetic responses, time to treatment failure, overall and event-free survival, and adverse events were assessed. An analysis of molecular response at 12 months was planned. A superior molecular response was defined as a decrease in the ratio of transcripts of the tyrosine kinase gene BCR-ABL to transcripts of ABL of 0.01% or less, corresponding to a reduction of 4 log(10) units or more from the baseline level, as assessed by means of a real-time quantitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay. RESULTS: At 12 months, the rates of cytogenetic response were similar among the four groups. The rate of a superior molecular response was significantly higher among patients receiving imatinib and peginterferon alfa-2a (30%) than among patients receiving 400 mg of imatinib alone (14%) (P=0.001). The rate was significantly higher among patients treated for more than 12 months than among those treated for 12 months or less. Gastrointestinal events were more frequent among patients receiving cytarabine, whereas rash and depression were more frequent among patients receiving peginterferon alfa-2a. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with other treatments, the addition of peginterferon alfa-2a to imatinib therapy resulted in significantly higher rates of molecular response in patients with chronic-phase CML.

CONTEXT: Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas are genetically heterogeneous neural crest-derived neoplasms. We recently identified germline mutations of the novel transmembrane-encoding gene FP/TMEM127 in familial and sporadic pheochromocytomas consistent with a tumor suppressor effect. OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence and spectrum of FP/TMEM127 mutations in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas and to test the effect of mutations in vitro. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We sequenced the FP/TMEM127 gene in 990 individuals with pheochromocytomas and/or paragangliomas, including 898 previously unreported cases without mutations in other susceptibility genes from 8 independent worldwide referral centers between January 2009 and June 2010. A multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based method was developed to screen for large gene deletions in 545 of these samples. Confocal microscopy of 5 transfected mutant proteins was used to determine their subcellular localization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The frequency and type of FP/TMEM127 mutation or deletion was assessed and correlated with clinical variables; the subcellular localization of 5 overexpressed mutants was compared with wild-type FP/TMEM127 protein. RESULTS: We identified 19 potentially pathogenic FP/TMEM127 germline mutations in 20 independent families, but no large deletions were detected. All mutation carriers had adrenal tumors, including 7 bilateral (P = 2.7 x 10(-4)) and/or with familial disease (5 of 20 samples; P = .005). The median age at disease onset in the FP/TMEM127 mutation group was similar to that of patients without a mutation (41.5 vs 45 years, respectively; P = .54). The most common presentation was that of a single benign adrenal tumor in patients older than 40 years. Malignancy was seen in 1 mutation carrier (5%). Expression of 5 novel FP/TMEM127 mutations in cell lines revealed diffuse localization of the mutant proteins in contrast with the discrete multiorganelle distribution of wild-type TMEM127. CONCLUSIONS: Germline mutations of FP/TMEM127 were associated with pheochromocytoma but not paraganglioma and occurred in an age group frequently excluded from genetic screening algorithms. Disease-associated mutations disrupt intracellular distribution of the FP/TMEM127 protein.",cancer"The feasibility and efficacy of eccentric exercise with older cancer survivors: a preliminary study. INTRODUCTION: Older individuals who have survived cancer and the commensurate treatment often experience a reduced quality of life in part due to their impaired muscular abilities and deficits in mobility. The purpose of this preliminary study was to determine the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of resistance exercise via negative, eccentrically induced work (RENEW) with older cancer survivors. METHODS: Older cancer survivors with a perception of moderate muscle weakness and fatigue participated in 12 weeks of RENEW. Measures of feasibility included (1) the participant's ability to progress the total amount of work of RENEW; (2) whether peak knee extension torque production became impaired; and (3) whether RENEW induced leg muscle pain as measured on a visual analog scale. The preliminary measure of efficacy included the performance of a timed up-and-go mobility test. RESULTS: The participants significantly increased the total average work per week over the 12 weeks of RENEW. Participants increased (P < .001) their work approximately 3-fold from week 3 (7.6 [5.11 kJ) to week 12 (22.1 [14.8] kJ) without muscle pain over the 12-week RENEW training period. Knee extension peak torque production improved (11%) significantly (P = .02) (pretest: 248 [92] N; posttest: 275 [99] N) after 12 weeks of RENEW. The time to perform the up-and-go test improved (14%) significantly (P < .001) (pretest: 8.4 [2.7]; posttest: 7.2 [2.3] s) after 12 weeks of RENEW, suggesting preliminary efficacy. CONCLUSION: Collectively, RENEW appears feasible and potentially efficacious for older, weak, and fatigued cancer survivors. Implications for Cancer Survivors: The use of eccentric muscle exercise may be ideally suited for older cancer survivors due to its high force and low energetic-cost capabilities.",cancer"Weight lifting for women at risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema: a randomized trial. CONTEXT: Clinical guidelines for breast cancer survivors without lymphedema advise against upper body exercise, preventing them from obtaining established health benefits of weight lifting. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate lymphedema onset after a 1-year weight lifting intervention vs no exercise (control) among survivors at risk for breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized controlled equivalence trial (Physical Activity and Lymphedema trial) in the Philadelphia metropolitan area of 154 breast cancer survivors 1 to 5 years postunilateral breast cancer, with at least 2 lymph nodes removed and without clinical signs of BCRL at study entry. Participants were recruited between October 1, 2005, and February 2007, with data collection ending in August 2008. INTERVENTION: Weight lifting intervention included a gym membership and 13 weeks of supervised instruction, with the remaining 9 months unsupervised, vs no exercise. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Incident BCRL determined by increased arm swelling during 12 months (>/=5% increase in interlimb difference). Clinician-defined BCRL onset was also evaluated. Equivalence margin was defined as doubling of lymphedema incidence. RESULTS: A total of 134 participants completed follow-up measures at 1 year. The proportion of women who experienced incident BCRL onset was 11% (8 of 72) in the weight lifting intervention group and 17% (13 of 75) in the control group (cumulative incidence difference [CID], -6.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -17.2% to 5.2%; P for equivalence = .04). Among women with 5 or more lymph nodes removed, the proportion who experienced incident BCRL onset was 7% (3 of 45) in the weight lifting intervention group and 22% (11 of 49) in the control group (CID, -15.0%; 95% CI, -18.6% to -11.4%; P for equivalence = .003). Clinician-defined BCRL onset occurred in 1 woman in the weight lifting intervention group and 3 women in the control group (1.5% vs 4.4%, P for equivalence = .12). CONCLUSION: In breast cancer survivors at risk for lymphedema, a program of slowly progressive weight lifting compared with no exercise did not result in increased incidence of lymphedema.

The imaging modality used to diagnose and monitor brain gliomas is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with standard protocols including contrast-enhanced T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) image sequences. Many clinical trials are currently using contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR image sequences to evaluate tumor response to treatment, but it is our hypothesis that FLAIR sequences will detect higher tumor volumes and, therefore, should be the preferred image sequence for this purpose. In this retrospective study, a volumetric analysis was conducted on the post-contrast T1-weighted and FLAIR MR image sequences of 38 patients with confirmed brain gliomas. The two volumes were subsequently found to have a statistically significant positive correlation. The FLAIR volume was also found to be greater than the post-contrast T1-weighted volume in all 38 patients. As a result, FLAIR image sequences provide a more complete characterization of gliomas and may be more beneficial when observing tumor response after treatment.",cancerIdiopathic autoimmune thrombocytopenia purpura in a 12-year-old boy.

CONTEXT: Immunochemical fecal occult blood tests (iFOBTs) are potentially promising tools for colorectal cancer screening. Low-dose aspirin use, which increases the likelihood of gastrointestinal bleeding, is common in the target population for colorectal cancer screening. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of low-dose aspirin use with the performance of 2 quantitative iFOBTs in a large sample of patients undergoing colorectal cancer screening. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Diagnostic study conducted from 2005 through 2009 at internal medicine and gastroenterology practices in southern Germany including 1979 patients (mean age, 62.1 years): 233 regular users of low-dose aspirin (167 men, 67 women) and 1746 who never used low-dose aspirin (809 men, 937 women). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves in detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms (colorectal cancer or advanced adenoma) with 2 quantitative iFOBTs. RESULTS: Advanced neoplasms were found in 24 users (10.3%) and 181 nonusers (10.4%) of low-dose aspirin. At the cut point recommended by the manufacturer, sensitivities of the 2 tests were 70.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48.9%-87.4%) for users compared with 35.9% (95% CI, 28.9%-43.4%) for nonusers and 58.3% (95% CI, 36.6%-77.9%) for users compared with 32.0% (95% CI, 25.3%-39.4%) for nonusers (P = .001 and P = .01, respectively). Specificities were 85.7% (95% CI, 80.2%-90.1%) for users compared with 89.2% (95% CI, 87.6%-90.7%) for nonusers and 85.7% (95% CI, 80.2%-90.1%) for users compared with 91.1% (95% CI, 89.5%-92.4%) for nonusers (P = .13 and P = .01, respectively). The areas under the ROC curve were 0.79 (95% CI, 0.68-0.90) for users compared with 0.67 (95% CI, 0.62-0.71) for nonusers and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.62-0.85) for users compared with 0.65 (95% CI, 0.61-0.69) for nonusers (P = .05 and P = .17, respectively). Among men, who composed the majority of low-dose aspirin users, the areas under the ROC curve were 0.87 (95% CI, 0.76-0.98) for users compared with 0.68 (95% CI, 0.63-0.74) for nonusers and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.68-0.93) for users compared with 0.67 (95% CI, 0.61-0.72) for nonusers (P = .003 and P = .04, respectively). CONCLUSION: For 2 iFOBTs, use of low-dose aspirin compared with no aspirin was associated with a markedly higher sensitivity for detecting advanced colorectal neoplasms, with only a slightly lower specificity.",cancer"Pediatric anaplastic large cell lymphoma presenting as generalized lymphadenopathy. Because a finding of generalized lymphadenopathy can be associated with such a wide range of diseases and conditions, determining its cause can sometimes be challenging. Infectious causes are the most common; however, it is important also to consider other entities in the workup. Here we present the case of a 3-year-old girl with generalized lymphadenopathy and fever, in whom the cause of the symptoms was initially thought to be infectious. Ultimately, however, anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) was diagnosed. Using this case as a backdrop, we discuss the wide range of systemic illnesses that the differential diagnosis of generalized lymphadenopathy encompasses--including infectious, autoimmune, and oncological disorders. We discuss the different findings typically seen in the various entities that figure prominently in the differential, and we outline investigations that can help narrow it. Finally, we present an overview of ALCL, one of the more rare pediatric malignancies.",cancer"Head and neck cancer: changing epidemiology and public health implications. Characterizing the epidemiology of head and neck cancers is challenging and has received limited attention in the medical literature. Traditionally, 80%-90% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) have been attributed to tobacco and alcohol use, but with growing public awareness and tobacco control efforts over the past few decades, there has been a downward trend in smoking prevalence in the US. There is also emerging evidence that human papillomavirus (HPV) is responsible for inconsistencies in HNSCC trends, with oncogenic HPV DNA found in approximately half of oropharyngeal cancers and in a high proportion of oropharyngeal cancers in nonsmokers and nondrinkers. The risk to HNSCC epidemiology is that whatever gains continue to be made in tobacco control may become lost in the increasing numbers of oropharyngeal cancers due to HPV. The purpose of this review is to explore the changing epidemiology of HNSCC, focusing on how it has been shaped by health policy and advocacy interventions and how it will continue to have public health implications in the future, particularly in considering preventive strategies against HPV. Given that the majority of HNSCCs are the result of exposure to preventable public health risks, more focus should be given to this area.",cancer"Systemic approaches for multifocal bronchioloalveolar carcinoma: is there an appropriate target? Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is a subset of pulmonary adenocarcinoma characterized by distinct and unique pathological, molecular, radiographic, and clinical features. While the incidence of pure BAC is rare, comprising only 1% to 4% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), mixed subtypes (including BAC with focal invasion and adenocarcinoma with BAC features) represent as much as 20% of adenocarcinomas--and that figure may be increasing. Despite the longstanding recognition of this entity, there is no established treatment paradigm for patients with multifocal BAC, resulting in competing approaches and treatment controversies. Current options for multifocal BAC include both surgery and systemic therapies. Unfortunately, prospective data on systemic approaches are limited by study design and small patient numbers; there are only seven phase II studies involving four therapies. This article evaluates key characteristics of BAC, including the current understanding of histopathology and tumor biology. In addition, it comprehensively reviews the systemic phase II studies in an attempt to clarify the therapeutic challenges in this disease. It also includes the first proposed treatment paradigm that integrates both EGFR mutational status and the sub-histologies, mucinous and nonmucinous BAC.",cancer"Current practice in dental oncology in the U.K. The clinical management of cancer patients, particularly where it affects the head and neck, may result in short- and long-term complications.

Cancer is the outcome of a complex multifactorial process of cytogenetic and epigenetic changes that affect cell cycle progression, apoptosis, DNA repair mechanisms and cell differentiation. Cancer cells have the capacity to evade the immune system, to invade tissues and to metastasize. Cancer is treated by surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy, each as single treatment modalities or more often in combination. Failure of treatment to cure a patient of cancer may be owing to the fact that radiotherapy and chemotherapy can eradicate transit-amplifying cells which are characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and prolonged survival; but cannot eradicate all cancer stem cells that divide slowly, have a relatively unlimited self-renewal capacity and express anti-apoptotic genes; and also owing to the fact that surgery cannot always eliminate occult fields of pre-cancerization.",cancer"Chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-induced oral mucositis: pathobiology, epidemiology and management. Oral mucositis is a debilitating complication of anticancer treatment, characterised by erythematous, atrophic, erosive or ulcerative lesions.

The pathophysiology of the condition is not well understood. Guidelines to the treatment of oral mucositis are often contradictory so that there is no evidence based standard treatment protocol. Therefore the treatment is empiric.

BACKGROUND: Although survival of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia has improved greatly in the past two decades, the outcome of those who relapse has remained static. We investigated the outcome of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who relapsed on present therapeutic regimens. METHODS: This open-label randomised trial was undertaken in 22 centres in the UK and Ireland and nine in Australia and New Zealand. Patients aged 1-18 years with first relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia were stratified into high-risk, intermediate-risk, and standard-risk groups on the basis of duration of first complete remission, site of relapse, and immunophenotype. All patients were allocated to receive either idarubicin or mitoxantrone in induction by stratified concealed randomisation. Neither patients nor those giving interventions were masked. After three blocks of therapy, all high-risk group patients and those from the intermediate group with postinduction high minimal residual disease (>/=10(-4) cells) received an allogenic stem-cell transplant. Standard-risk and intermediate-risk patients with postinduction low minimal residual disease (<10(-4) cells) continued chemotherapy. The primary outcome was progression-free survival and the method of analysis was intention-to-treat. Randomisation was stopped in December, 2007 because of differences in progression-free and overall survival between the two groups. This trial is registered, reference number ISCRTN45724312. FINDINGS: Of 239 registered patients, 216 were randomly assigned to either idarubicin (109 analysed) or mitoxantrone (103 analysed). Estimated 3-year progression-free survival was 35.9% (95% CI 25.9-45.9) in the idarubicin group versus 64.6% (54.2-73.2) in the mitoxantrone group (p=0.0004), and 3-year overall survival was 45.2% (34.5-55.3) versus 69.0% (58.5-77.3; p=0.004). Differences in progression-free survival between groups were mainly related to a decrease in disease events (progression, second relapse, disease-related deaths; HR 0.56, 0.34-0.92, p=0.007) rather than an increase in adverse treatment effects (treatment death, second malignancy; HR 0.52, 0.24-1.11, p=0.11). INTERPRETATION: As compared with idarubicin, mitoxantrone conferred a significant benefit in progression-free and overall survival in children with relapsed acute lymphobastic leukaemia, a potentially useful clinical finding that warrants further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates reduce the risk of skeletal events in patients with malignant bone disease, and zoledronic acid has shown potential anticancer effects in preclinical and clinical studies. We aimed to establish whether bisphosphonates can affect clinical outcomes in patients with multiple myeloma. METHODS: Patients of age 18 years or older with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma were enrolled from 120 centres in the UK. Computer-generated randomisation sequence was used to allocate patients equally, via an automated telephone service, to receive 4 mg zoledronic acid as an infusion every 3-4 weeks or 1600 mg oral clodronic acid daily. Patients also received intensive or non-intensive induction chemotherapy. No investigators, staff, or patients were masked to treatment allocation, and bisphosphonate and maintenance therapy continued at least until disease progression. The primary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and overall response rate. We assessed between-group differences with Cox proportional hazards models for progression-free survival and overall survival, and with logistic regression models for overall response rate. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN68454111. FINDINGS: 1970 patients were enrolled between May, 2003, and November, 2007, of whom 1960 were eligible for intention-to-treat analysis: 981 in the zoledronic acid group (555 on intensive chemotherapy, 426 on non-intensive chemotherapy); and 979 on clodronic acid (556 on intensive chemotherapy, 423 on non-intensive chemotherapy). The treatment cutoff was Oct 5, 2009, with patients receiving bisphosphonates for a median of 350 days (IQR 137-632) before disease progression, with a median of 3.7 years' follow-up (IQR 2.9-4.7). Zoledronic acid reduced mortality by 16% (95% CI 4-26) versus clodronic acid (hazard ratio [HR] 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96; p=0.0118), and extended median overall survival by 5.5 months (50.0 months, IQR 21.0 to not reached vs 44.5 months, IQR 16.5 to not reached; p=0.04). Zoledronic acid also significantly improved progression-free survival by 12% (95% CI 2-20) versus clodronic acid (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80-0.98; p=0.0179), and increased median progression-free survival by 2.0 months (19.5 months, IQR 9.0-38.0 vs 17.5 months, IQR 8.5-34.0; p=0.07). Rates of complete, very good partial, or partial response did not differ significantly between the zoledronic acid and clodronic acid groups for patients receiving intensive induction chemotherapy (432 patients [78%] vs 422 [76%]; p=0.43) or non-intensive induction chemotherapy (215 [50%] vs 195 [46%]; p=0.18). Both bisphosphonates were generally well tolerated, with similar occurrence of acute renal failure and treatment-emergent serious adverse events, but zoledronic acid was associated with higher rates of confirmed osteonecrosis of the jaw (35 [4%]) than was clodronic acid (3 [<1%]). INTERPRETATION: Consistent with the potential anticancer activity of zoledronic acid, overall survival improved independently of prevention of skeletal-related events, showing that zoledronic acid has treatment benefits beyond bone health. These findings support immediate treatment with zoledronic acid in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma, not only for prevention of skeletal-related events, but also for potential antimyeloma benefits.

BACKGROUND: About 50% of patients (age >/=60 years) who have acute myeloid leukaemia and are otherwise medically healthy (ie, able to undergo intensive chemotherapy) achieve a complete remission (CR) after intensive chemotherapy, but with a substantially increased risk of early death (ED) compared with younger patients. We verified the association of standard clinical and laboratory variables with CR and ED and developed a web-based application for risk assessment of intensive chemotherapy in these patients. METHODS: Multivariate regression analysis was used to develop risk scores with or without knowledge of the cytogenetic and molecular risk profiles for a cohort of 1406 patients (aged >/=60 years) with acute myeloid leukaemia, but otherwise medically healthy, who were treated with two courses of intensive induction chemotherapy (tioguanine, standard-dose cytarabine, and daunorubicin followed by high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone; or with high-dose cytarabine and mitoxantrone in the first and second induction courses) in the German Acute Myeloid Leukaemia Cooperative Group 1999 study. Risk prediction was validated in an independent cohort of 801 patients (aged >60 years) with acute myeloid leukaemia who were given two courses of cytarabine and daunorubicin in the Acute Myeloid Leukaemia 1996 study. FINDINGS: Body temperature, age, de-novo leukaemia versus leukaemia secondary to cytotoxic treatment or an antecedent haematological disease, haemoglobin, platelet count, fibrinogen, and serum concentration of lactate dehydrogenase were significantly associated with CR or ED. The probability of CR with knowledge of cytogenetic and molecular risk (score 1) was from 12% to 91%, and without knowledge (score 2) from 21% to 80%. The predicted risk of ED was from 6% to 69% for score 1 and from 7% to 63% for score 2. The predictive power of the risk scores was confirmed in the independent patient cohort (CR score 1, from 10% to 91%; CR score 2, from 16% to 80%; ED score 1, from 6% to 69%; and ED score 2, from 7% to 61%). INTERPRETATION: The scores for acute myeloid leukaemia can be used to predict the probability of CR and the risk of ED in older patients with acute myeloid leukaemia, but otherwise medically healthy, for whom intensive induction chemotherapy is planned. This information can help physicians with difficult decisions for treatment of these patients. FUNDING: Deutsche Krebshilfe and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft.",cancer"Autophagy and metabolism. Autophagy is a process of self-cannibalization. Cells capture their own cytoplasm and organelles and consume them in lysosomes. The resulting breakdown products are inputs to cellular metabolism, through which they are used to generate energy and to build new proteins and membranes. Autophagy preserves the health of cells and tissues by replacing outdated and damaged cellular components with fresh ones. In starvation, it provides an internal source of nutrients for energy generation and, thus, survival. A powerful promoter of metabolic homeostasis at both the cellular and whole-animal level, autophagy prevents degenerative diseases. It does have a downside, however--cancer cells exploit it to survive in nutrient-poor tumors.",cancer"The control of the metabolic switch in cancers by oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Cells from some tumors use an altered metabolic pattern compared with that of normal differentiated adult cells in the body. Tumor cells take up much more glucose and mainly process it through aerobic glycolysis, producing large quantities of secreted lactate with a lower use of oxidative phosphorylation that would generate more adenosine triphosphate (ATP), water, and carbon dioxide. This is the Warburg effect, which provides substrates for cell growth and division and free energy (ATP) from enhanced glucose use. This metabolic switch places the emphasis on producing intermediates for cell growth and division, and it is regulated by both oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in a number of key cancer-producing pathways. Blocking these metabolic pathways or restoring these altered pathways could lead to a new approach in cancer treatments.",cancer"On getting there from here. Studies on a variety of interesting biological problems, ranging from circadian rhythm to cancer cell growth to longevity, have begun to give evidence that the physiological state of cells and tissues reflects both the cell's regulatory systems and its state of intermediary metabolism. It is appreciated that the regulatory state of a cell or tissue, as driven by transcription factors and signaling pathways, can impose itself upon the dynamics of metabolic state. It follows that the reciprocal must also be the case, that metabolic state will feed back to impose itself on regulatory state. An appreciation and understanding of this reciprocity may be required to crack open problems in biological research that have heretofore been insoluble.",cancerLate effects of cancer and cancer therapy on oral health and quality of life. Persisting and chronic oral complications of cancer therapy are common. Oral complications in cancer survivors are underreported but impact oral function and quality of life. Prevention and management of oral complications in cancer survivors requires interdisciplinary care. The purpose of this article is to review the common oral complications in cancer survivors.,cancer"The anterior extraperitoneal approach to the rare presacral/ retroperitoneal schwannoma. Presacral/retroperitoneal schwannomas are extremely unusual and their surgical approach is challenging. Various surgical approaches have been proposed. Here we describe our experience with the anterior extraperitoneal approach for the Type 3 presacral/retroperitoneal schwannoma. A 33-year-old woman presented with a history of infertility and a presacral/retroperitoneal mass. The patient underwent abdominal/pelvic CT and MRI that demonstrated presence of a solid, well circumscribed Type 3 presacral/retroperitoneal schwannoma. The anterior extraperitoneal approach was successfully used to remove the presacral/retroperitoneal schwannoma. The histopathological evaluation confirmed the preoperative diagnosis. The anterior extraperitoneal approach is helpful as an alternative approach in the surgical management of benign Type 3 presacral/retroperitoneal schwannomas (Fig. 4, Ref. 15).",cancer"Recurrent multiple cardiac myxomas. BACKGROUND: The recurrence of cardiac myxoma after a surgical excision is a rare condition. The mechanism responsible for the recurrence remains unclear. Multifocal growth of a benign myxoma or malignant transformation, inadequate resection, intraoperative implantation or embolization, familial disposition, and the abnormal DNA ploidy pattern play an important role in development of recurrent myxoma. CASE: We report the case of a 24-year-old female with recurrent multiple cardiac myxomas. She had an abortus 2 months ago. The patient had undergone a resection of left atrial and right ventricular myxoma with extension to the right pulmonary artery 8 years ago. The preoperative echocardiographic examinations revealed recurrent left atrial and right and left ventricular myxomas. The patient underwent a redo-surgery and, in addition to a large myxoma in the right ventricle with involvement of the tricuspid valve and anterior papillary muscle, three myxomas including both myxomas originating at the top and the base of the posterior papillary muscle, respectively, the other myxoma between both papillary muscles in the posterior wall of the left ventricle, and 2 more small myxomas including 1 in the interatrial septum and the other on atrial surface of anterior mitral annulus were found in the left ventricle and atrium. The myxomas were successfully excised through a transmitral approach with a combined bi-atrial incision. The tricuspid valve and mitral valve were repaired with annuloplasty. She had an uneventful postoperative course and no residual myxoma was found by echocardiography. CONCLUSION: We think that a long-term follow-up by echocardiography in all patients after the resection of myxoma is advised for an early detection of any recurrence (Fig. 5, Ref. 9).",cancer"Ileus, pregnancy or leiomyoma? A case of a large intraabdominal tumor. OBJECTIVE: Authors evaluate a case of an extremely large leiomyoma, its symptomatology, diagnosis and surgical treatment. They present the possible peroperative complications and emphasize the necessity of the interdisciplinary approach. METHODS: The set of patients consists of 21 patients with leiomyomas of various localizations. All patients were operated by means of conventional operation. The material was sent for classical bioptic examination with the use of immuno-histochemical analysis. RESULTS: Unlike found in literature, the most common appearance of leiomyoma in our set of patients was on small bowel, namely 10 of 21 patients had tumors in this localization. Furthermore there were three tumors of gynecological origin. Two of them had acute abdominal disease (AAD) while in these cases, ileus was a reason for urgent operations. In all three gynecological cases it was difficult to diagnose preoperatively the origin of tumors. In one patient, the preparation led to partial iatrogenic lesion of left ureter which was subsequently treated with primary suture. The authors describe zero mortality. CONCLUSION: Despite the relatively simple diagnosis of leiomyomas, in some cases of extreme size of the tumor combined with its localization in the small pelvis makes it difficult to distinguish it from other mesenchymal tumors. In order eliminate the peroperative complications it is possible to introduce a urethral catheter and to set up a multidisciplinary operation team to achieve combined experience (Fig. 5, Ref. 14).",cancer"Adjuvant docetaxel for high-risk, node-negative breast cancer. BACKGROUND: A regimen of docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (TAC) is superior to a regimen of fluorouracil, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (FAC) when used as adjuvant therapy in women with node-positive breast cancer. The value of taxanes in the treatment of node-negative disease has not been determined. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1060 women with axillary-node-negative breast cancer and at least one high-risk factor for recurrence (according to the 1998 St. Gallen criteria) to treatment with TAC or FAC every 3 weeks for six cycles after surgery. The primary end point was disease-free survival after at least 5 years of follow-up. Secondary end points included overall survival and toxicity. RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 77 months, the proportion of patients alive and disease-free was higher among the 539 women in the TAC group (87.8%) than among the 521 women in the FAC group (81.8%), representing a 32% reduction in the risk of recurrence with TAC (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49 to 0.93; P=0.01 by the log-rank test). This benefit was consistent, regardless of hormone-receptor status, menopausal status, or number of high-risk factors. The difference in survival rates (TAC, 95.2%; FAC, 93.5%) was not significant (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.26); however, the number of events was small (TAC, 26; FAC, 34). Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were 28.2% with TAC and 17.0% with FAC (P<0.001). Toxicity associated with TAC was diminished when primary prophylaxis with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was provided. CONCLUSIONS: As compared with adjuvant FAC, adjuvant TAC improved the rate of disease-free survival among women with high-risk, node-negative breast cancer.

One of the key obstacles against the success in cancer chemotherapy is the toxic and side effects of the chemotherapeutic agents. The avoidance of these toxic and side effects will greatly improve the therapeutic effects of anticancer drugs while decrease the pains of the patients. Here we show that activated carbon nanoparticles (ACNP), one of the mesoporous nanoparticles, can decrease the genotoxicity and teratogenicity of mitomycin C (MMC). To study the effects of ACNP on genotoxicity and teratogenicity of MMC, methods of PCE micronucleus test, Chinese hamster lung cell chromosome aberration experiment and rat teratogenicity were employed to observe the differences in genotoxicity and teratogenicity between ACNP-adsorbed MMC (ACNP-MMC) and free MMC. Results demonstrated that free MMC 0.16-5.0 microg/kg significantly increased the positive rate of PCE micronucleus test, the chromosome aberration rate and rat teratogenecity, but ACNP-MMC did not increased these heredity and reproduction toxicological indexes in a dose range of 0.625-10.0 microg/kg. From these results, it can be concluded that ACNP-MMC have significant effects to decrease the genotoxicity and teratogenicity effects of MMC. These results will have a considerable impact on the strategy of anticancer chemotherapy.",cancer"In vitro cytotoxicity of transparent yellow iron oxide nanoparticles on human glioma cells. With rapid development of nanotechnology, concerns about the possible adverse health effects on human beings by using nanomaterials have been raised. Transparent yellow iron oxide (alpha-FeOOH) nanoparticles have been widely used in paints, plastic, rubber, building materials, papermaking, food products and pharmaceutical industry, thus the potential health implications by the exposure should be considered. The purpose of this study is to assess the cytotoxicity of transparent yellow iron oxide nanoparticles on U251 human glioma cells. The alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles are in clubbed shapes with 9 nm in diameter and 43 nm long. The specific surface area is 115.3 m2/g. After physicochemical characterization of the nanoparticles, U251 cells were exposed to a-FeOOH at the doses of 0, 3.75, 15, 60 and 120 microg/mL. The results showed that the alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles reduced the cell viability and induced necrosis and apoptosis in U251 cells. In addition, nanoparticle exposure significantly increased the levels of superoxide anion and nitric oxide in a dose-dependent fashion in the cells. Our results suggest that exposure to alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles induce significant free radical formation and cytotoxic effects. The large surface area that induced high surface reactivity may play an important role in the cytotoxic effect of alpha-FeOOH nanoparticles.",cancer"Preferential killing of cancer cells using silicon carbide quantum dots. Silicon carbide quantum dots are highly luminescent biocompatible nanoparticles whose properties might be of particular interest for biomedical applications. In this study we investigated Silicon Carbide Quantum Dots (3C-SiC QDs) cellular localisation and influence on viability and proliferation on oral squamous carcinoma (AT-84 and HSC) and immortalized cell lines (S-G). They clearly localize into the nuclei, but the presence of 3C-SiC QDs in culture medium provoke morphological changes in cultured cells. We demonstrate that 3C-SiC QDs display dose- and time-dependent selective cytotoxicity on cancer versus immortalized cells in vitro. Since one of the limitations of classical antineoplastic drugs is their lack of selectivity, these results open a new way in the search for antiproliferative drugs.",cancer"Process for determining the cancer burden of the Hopi Tribe. The Hopi Tribe is located in the northeastern part of Arizona on more than one million acres of federally reserved land. Tribally based community research, conducted in collaboration with University of Arizona researchers, has been successfully implemented on Hopi beginning with a cross-sectional community survey in 1993 and continuing with a second survey in 2006. Both surveys identified a strong community interest in cancer. This article reports on the process involved in a third study, in which official Hopi enrollment data were matched with Arizona Cancer Registry data. The process involved bringing in a new partner and obtaining tribal, state, and university approvals, as well as a signed data exchange agreement between the state and the Hopi Tribe. Technical implementation of the data match required computer programming and epidemiologic expertise, as well as an understanding of the community and the culture. Close collaboration among Hopi residents and university epidemiologists was critical.",cancer"Mediastinal teratoma mimicking massive pleural effusion. Immature mediastinal teratoma is very rare, found in only 1% of all mediastinal teratomas. Raised serum alpha feto-protein acts as important surrogate marker for both diagnosis and follow up in such cases. Surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy are keys in the management, especially in patients older than 15 years of age. We present a 14-year-boy presenting clinico-radiologically as left sided massive pleural effusion. Raised serum marker as well as excision biopsy of the mediastinal mass following thoracotomy were indicative of a diagnosis of immature teratoma.",cancer"Calcium and magnesium in drinking water and risk of death from kidney cancer. The possible association between the risk of kidney cancer development and the levels of calcium and magnesium in drinking water from municipal supplies was investigated in a matched cancer case-control study in Taiwan. All eligible kidney cancer deaths (1778 cases) of Taiwan residents from 1999 through 2008 were compared with deaths from other causes (1778 controls), and the levels of calcium and magnesium in drinking water of these residents were determined. Data on calcium and magnesium levels in drinking water throughout Taiwan were obtained from the Taiwan Water Supply Corporation (TWSC). The control group consisted of individuals who died from other causes, and the controls were pair-matched to the cancer cases by gender, year of birth, and year of death. The adjusted odd ratios for death attributed to kidney cancer for individuals with higher calcium levels in their drinking water, as compared to the lowest tertile, were 0.89 (95% CI = 0.72-1.11) and 0.78 (95% CI = 0.62-0.98), respectively. The adjusted odd ratios were not statistically significant for the relationship between magnesium levels in drinking water and kidney cancer development. The results of the present study demonstrate that there may be a significant protective effect of calcium intake from drinking water against the risk of death due to kidney cancer.",cancer"The use of osteo-articular allografts for reconstruction after resection of the distal radius for tumour. Several techniques have been described to reconstruct a mobile wrist joint after resection of the distal radius for tumour. We reviewed our experience of using an osteo-articular allograft to do this in 17 patients with a mean follow-up of 58.9 months (28 to 119). The mean range of movement at the wrist was 56 degrees flexion, 58 degrees extension, 84 degrees supination and 80 degrees pronation. The mean ISOLS-MSTS score was 86% (63% to 97%) and the mean patient-rated wrist evaluation score was 16.5 (3 to 34). There was no local recurrence or distant metastases. The procedure failed in one patient with a fracture of the graft and an arthrodesis was finally required. Union was achieved at the host-graft interface in all except two cases. No patient reported more than modest non-disabling pain and six reported no pain at all. Radiographs showed early degenerative changes at the radiocarpal joint in every patient. A functional pain-free wrist can be restored with an osteo-articular allograft after resection of the distal radius for bone tumour, thereby avoiding the donor site morbidity associated with an autograft. These results may deteriorate with time.",cancer"Use of metal proximal radial endoprostheses for treatment of non-traumatic disorders: a case series. We have reviewed five adult patients treated with endoprosthetic reconstruction of the proximal radius following resection of non-traumatic lesions. The patients had a mean age of 33.4 years (20 to 60) at the time of surgery and the mean follow-up was 7.6 years (0.8 to 16). Following surgery, all elbows were clinically stable and there was 100% survivorship of the prosthesis. Evaluation of function was assessed clinically and by the Mayo Elbow Performance Score, achieving a mean of 86% (70 to 100). Results at medium-term follow-up are encouraging with regards to elbow stability, implant survivorship and functional outcome.",cancer"Baseline characteristics of participants in the randomized national lung screening trial. BACKGROUND: The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a randomized study conducted at 33 US sites, is comparing lung cancer mortality among persons screened with reduced dose helical computerized tomography and among persons screened with chest radiograph. In this article, we present characteristics of the study population. METHODS: Eligible participants were aged 55-74 years and were current or former smokers with a cigarette smoking history of at least 30 pack-years. Randomization was stratified by site, sex, and age. To assess representativeness of the study population, demographic characteristics of individuals from the general population who met NLST age and smoking history inclusion criteria were obtained from the Tobacco Use Supplement of the US Census Bureau Current Population Surveys. RESULTS: The NLST enrolled 53 456 persons, with 26 733 randomly assigned to chest radiograph screening and 26 723 to computerized tomography screening. Characteristics of the participants were as follows: 31 533 (59%) were men, 39 234 (73%) were younger than 65 years, 25 779 (48%) were current smokers, and 16 839 (32%) had a college or higher degree. Median cigarette exposure was 48 pack-years. Among Tobacco Use Supplement respondents who met NLST age and smoking history criteria, 59% were men, 65% were younger than 65 years, and 57% were current smokers. Median cigarette exposure among this group was 47 pack-years, and 14% had a college degree or higher. CONCLUSION: The NLST cohort has a distribution of sex and pack-year history that is similar to the component of the general US population that meets the major NLST eligibility criteria; however, NLST participants are younger, better educated, and less likely to be current smokers.",cancer"Multiple myeloma precursor disease. Recent data indicate that multiple myeloma is consistently preceded by the precursor states of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering myeloma. Currently, multiple myeloma is a clinical diagnosis based on manifestations including hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions, whereas MGUS and smoldering myeloma are diagnosed based on laboratory abnormalities. Current clinical markers allow for more individualized risk stratification and counseling of these patients. However, there is a dearth of biomarkers and molecular imaging techniques capable of (1) accurately identifying patients with disease biology corresponding with high risk of progression; (2) elucidating the mechanism of transformation to multiple myeloma; and (3) forming a framework for development of targeted therapies. This case presentation and review discusses the current understanding of myeloma precursor disease and future opportunities for improving personalized management of patients with MGUS or smoldering myeloma, as well as the potential for developing early treatment strategies designed to delay and prevent development of multiple myeloma.",cancer"Active surveillance compared with initial treatment for men with low-risk prostate cancer: a decision analysis. CONTEXT: In the United States, 192,000 men were diagnosed as having prostate cancer in 2009, the majority with low-risk, clinically localized disease. Treatment of these cancers is associated with substantial morbidity. Active surveillance is an alternative to initial treatment, but long-term outcomes and effect on quality of life have not been well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To examine the quality-of-life benefits and risks of active surveillance compared with initial treatment for men with low-risk, clinically localized prostate cancer. DESIGN AND SETTING: Decision analysis using a simulation model was performed: men were treated at diagnosis with brachytherapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), or radical prostatectomy or followed up by active surveillance (a strategy of close monitoring of newly diagnosed patients with serial prostate-specific antigen measurements, digital rectal examinations, and biopsies, with treatment at disease progression or patient choice). Probabilities and utilities were derived from previous studies and literature review. In the base case, the relative risk of prostate cancer-specific death for initial treatment vs active surveillance was assumed to be 0.83. Men incurred short- and long-term adverse effects of treatment. PATIENTS: Hypothetical cohorts of 65-year-old men newly diagnosed as having clinically localized, low-risk prostate cancer (prostate-specific antigen level <10 ng/mL, stage </=T2a disease, and Gleason score </=6). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE). RESULTS: Active surveillance was associated with the greatest QALE (11.07 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), followed by brachytherapy (10.57 QALYs), IMRT (10.51 QALYs), and radical prostatectomy (10.23 QALYs). Active surveillance remained associated with the highest QALE even if the relative risk of prostate cancer-specific death for initial treatment vs active surveillance was as low as 0.6. However, the QALE gains and the optimal strategy were highly dependent on individual preferences for living under active surveillance and for having been treated. CONCLUSIONS: Under a wide range of assumptions, for a 65-year-old man, active surveillance is a reasonable approach to low-risk prostate cancer based on QALE compared with initial treatment. However, individual preferences play a central role in the decision whether to treat or to pursue active surveillance.",cancer"Ovarian small cell carcinoma, hypercalcemic type exhibiting a response to high-dose chemotherapy. A gravida 2, para 2 25-year-old woman three months post-partum presented to her primary physician with abdominal pain and bloating; a 20-cm complex cystic pelvic mass was identified by ultrasound. No ovarian masses were noted during ultrasound exam at the prior pregnancy, less than one year earlier. Her labs included hypercalcemia (11.8 mg/dL, normal less than 10.5) and an elevated CA 125 (160 U/mL, normal less than 35). An exploratory laparotomy revealed a 20-cm right ovarian mass. Frozen section was performed and a sex cord-stromal tumor was favored. Permanent sections of the specimen, however, revealed round, closely packed neoplastic cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasm ratio and high mitotic rate growing in a diffuse pattern with scattered follicle-like, ill-defined microcystic spaces. Immunohistochemical stains revealed the neoplasm to be focally positive for keratin and negative for inhibin. The final diagnosis rendered was small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type. Further staging revealed para-aortic lymph node involvement (stage IIIC). Current literature suggests a very poor prognosis for these neoplasms despite aggressive therapy, with an overall survival rate of 10 percent. Rare response has been noted, however, with high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Our patient underwent a rigorous chemotherapeutic regimen followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant, and as of August 2010, (17 months after initial diagnosis), the patient has had no recurrence.",cancer"Differences in attributions of mental illness and social distance for portrayals of four mental disorders. For individuals with mental illness, others' perceptions of mental illness often limit integration into communities. Perceptions of mental illness manifest as social stigma in the form of social distance and may depend on individuals' attributions of the origins of mental illness. 180 university students completed a survey on attribution of mental illness and social distance across several disorders (psychiatric and physical). Participants indicated greater social distance for severe mental illness (i.e., schizophrenia) than less severe mental illness and physical illness. More desire for social distance may be related to unfamiliarity with severe mental illness rather than less severe mental and physical illnesses. Greater understanding of how individuals perceive mental illness can inform efforts to educate the public.",cancer"PET/CT in oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer in post therapy setting. 18F-FDG PET/CT is an immerging tool for follow-up a head and neck cancerpatients. Accurate PET/CT interpretation in a post therapy setting is crucial for proper management. However there are many limitations in post therapy settings. For example, variable degree of normal physiologic uptake is noted. Physiologic processes cannot be identified by symmetrical FDG uptake in a post therapy setting. The present article demonstrates case series including asymmetrical, abnormal, or unusual patterns of FDG uptake within the oral cavity and oropharyngeal structures in both benign and malignant conditions.",cancer"Villous adenoma of the urinary bladder: a case report. Villous adenomas of the urinary tract are rare, in contrast to urothelial neoplasms. Most reports were scattered individual cases. Only two case series of this entity have been published. The histopathology is identical to that of the much more common villous adenoma of the gastrointestinal tract. The authors reported a case of urinary bladder villous adenoma in a 41-year-old Thai patient who complained of hematuria for one day without any other symptom. Cystoscopic examination revealed a papillary growth at the bladder neck associated with marked degree of bullous edema and bilateral mild hydroureters. The clinical diagnosis was urothelial carcinoma. Transurethral resection was performed Histologic examination revealed typical features of villous adenoma. The tumor showed identical immunohistochemical profile to colonic villous adenoma. The patient has been well for more than a year after tumor removal.",cancer"Acute appendicitis as primary symptom of prostatic adenocarcinoma: report of a case. The most common disease ofappendix is acute appendicitis. There have been at least 20 case reports of metastasis-induced appendicitis in English literature. The authors reported a 62-year-old Thai man who underwent appendectomy due to classical symptoms and signs of acute appendicitis and was subsequently referred to Siriraj Hospital for proper management after a pathological report of metastatic adenocarcinoma to the appendix. By morphology, the primary site was thought to be the prostate gland. Confirmation was done based on serum PSA study, transrectal ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy, and review of the material from Hua Hin Hospital. Orchidectomy was performed with satisfactory outcome. The patient was doing well for two years before upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage and obstructive jaundice caused by another aggressive tumor developed. He died of the second tumor associated with subsequent renal failure in spite of good response to orchidectomy.",cancerGranulomatous mycosis fungoides with large cell transformation misdiagnosed as leprosy. BACKGROUND: Granulomatous mycosis fungoides is an unusual histopathological variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma without clinical distinction from classic mycosis fungoides. Symptoms associated with peripheral nerve involvement have rarely been reported in the literature. CASE REPORT: The authors described a case of granulomatous MF stage IIB with large cell transformation who initially presented with leprosy-like condition and chronic left peroneal neuropathy The patient received six courses ofgemcitabine with greater than 90% improvement of skin lesions. The rest of the lesions were successfully treated with local electron beam radiation. CONCLUSION: Granulomatous MF with neuropathy can be clinically misdiagnosed if there is no histopathological and immunohistochemical finding to support the diagnosis of lymphoma.,cancer"Double check up of malignancy biopsy specimens for patient safety. BACKGROUND: The diagnostic of malignancy in biopsy specimens is very important because it guides to selected treatment option and prognostic prediction. However biopsy specimens usually have small pieces leading to variations of the interpretation by anatomical pathologists. OBJECTIVE: To detect and correct the errors or the significant discrepancies in the diagnosis of biopsy specimens before sign-out and to determine the frequency of anatomic pathology significant discrepancies. DESIGN: The application of the mutually agreed work instructions (record) for the detection of errors or the significant discrepancies and their process of sign-out. The record of biopsy specimen that received a secondary check (1959 cases, 2005-2007) was analyzed. RESULTS: After a secondary check, 53 cases of non-malignancy for any reason by a second pathologist were included. However when using our definition on significant discrepancies, only 37 cases were considered. Another seven cases with the opinions with malignancy that were of different cell types that do harm to the patients were added. Therefore, 44 cases (2.25%) had truly significant discrepancies. CONCLUSION: The truly significant discrepancy frequency was 2.25% during the process of pre-sign-out secondary check of malignancy of biopsy specimens. The project has been applied as a routine daily work. It can be an innovative safety program for patient in Thailand.",cancer"Results of multidisciplinary therapy of squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa at Srinagarind Hospital, Thailand. OBJECTIVE: Review the clinical presentation and treatment of buccal carcinoma and compare it to the results of treatment as per survival rate. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors reviewed the medical records of newly diagnosed seen between 1995 and 2005 at the Division of Plastic Surgery and the Department of Radiotherapy, Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University Patients previously treated elsewhere or those whose lesions secondarily involved the buccal mucosa were excluded. RESULTS: The authors reviewed the medical records of 107 buccal carcinoma patients (94 females and 13 males) averaging 67 years of age. The 5-year survival rates of patients with Stage I (5.6%), 11 (6.5%), III (12.1%), and IVa (75.7%) were 67%, 43%, 47%, and 26%, respectively. A combined modality treatment (surgery and radiation or chemotherapy) was used to treat the advanced stage (III and IV) patients. The rate of incomplete therapy was high (47.78%). In the group that completed the protocol (i.e., neoadjuvant, surgery, and post operative radiation), there were five patients for whom the 5-year survival seemed higher than the patients who followed the standard treatment of surgery and post-operative radiation but it was not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: The treatment of buccal carcinoma requires a multidisciplinary team approach because most of the patients are elderly and present with an advanced stage. If treatment continues through to completion of the protocol, the survival rate would increase.",cancer"Radical esophagectomy for esophageal cancer: results in Thai patients. BACKGROUND: Radical esophagectomy was reported to have prolonged survival in patients with esophageal cancer However, it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Controversy still exists regarding value of radical esophagectomy MATERIAL AND METHOD: The authors analyzed the results, including complications and survival in 68 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer who were treated with transthoracic radical esophagectomy at the Department of Surgery, Siriraj hospital, Mahidol University between June 2002 and June 2008. RESULTS: There were 57 males and eight females with a mean age of 59.28 +/- 11.25 years. Regarding T staging, 81.5% of the patients were in T3 stage while 1.5% of the patients had Ti stage, 15.4% had T2 stage, and 1.5% had T4 stage. Lymph node metastasis (NI) was found in 63.1% of the patients and NO was in 36.9%. Most of the patients were in advanced stages with 53.8% in stage III, 44.6% in stage II, and 1.5% in stage I. The 5-year survival rate of the patients with node positive was significantly lower than the patients with node negative (p = 0.018). The survival was significantly better in stage Ilcompared to stage III (p = 0.012). Overall 5-year survival rate was 28. 5%. Most common complications were from pulmonary causes (22.1%), anastomotic leakage (8.8%), and wound infection (8.8%). Mortality rate was 4.41%. CONCLUSION: Radical esophagectomy was associated with relatively low mortality and acceptable survival. It should be considered in surgical treatment of patients with esophageal cancer",cancer"Obstructive uropathy following radiation therapy in carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Eighty-three cases of carcinoma of the cervix presenting over a 5-year period, 1997 to 2001 were considered for evaluation of the effects of Irradiation on the urinary tract. Ultrasound scans were used to detect ureteric obstructions in the follow-up period. Significant progressive ureteric obstruction occurred in 6 patients (7.2%), all of whom had malignant strictures. The diagnoses of these strictures were made between 8 months and five years after the Initial treatment. Patients having malignant stricture tend to be in a higher original stage of tumour. The lower ureter was the site of ureteric obstruction in 4 patients while 2 had lesions in middle ureter. The latency period between primary treatment of the tumour and diagnosis of uropathy is significantly shorter for malignant strictures. The site of occurrence of the strictures had no discernible significance but the absence of a bilateral obstruction in spite of all of them being malignant lesions is in disagreement with the published data.",cancerCo-existing tubercular axillary lymphadenitis with carcinoma breast can falsely over-stage the disease--case series. The synchronous occurrence of tuberculosis and carcinoma in breast is unusual. The simultaneous occurrence of both the diseases can complicate the neoplastic disease. The diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in a patient with cancer assumes importance as it can prevent high mortality in patients with co-existent disease and thereby create problems in treatment decision. Axillary lymph node enlargement in breast cancer patient is not always caused by metastatic tumour of the breast even in the ipsilateral axillary nodes. We present here six case reports as an example of tuberculous axillary lymphadenitis co-existing with invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. Accurate diagnosis has helped in down-staging carcinoma of the breast and also in identifying curable disease.,cancer"Alpha-fetoprotein secretion in a craniopharyngioma. Are craniopharyngiomas part of the germ cell tumor family? A 14-months-old girl was admitted to our hospital because of excessive irritability and abnormal eye movements over the last two months. Brain CT and MRI revealed a suprasellar cystic and partially solid mass with calcifications. The laboratory investigation revealed increased serum levels of AFP. These findings were suggestive for a brain germ cell tumor. Therefore, systemic chemotherapy was started. After two courses there was a reduction in the levels of AFP but the tumor size remained unchanged. Subtotal tumor excision was performed that revealed the presence of a craniopharyngioma. One month later there was enlargement of the cystic part of the tumor, while serum AFP was elevated. The child received again systemic chemotherapy and placement of a reservoir into the cystic part of the tumor. Analysis of the intracystic flouid revealed the presence of beta-HCG and AFP. Following that the patient received brachytherapy with intracavity yttrium placement. Three months later repeated MRI showed a decrease in the size of the cystic part, while the solid part remained unchanged. Thus, the solid part was treated by radiosurgery. One year later the patient was stable but with complete loss of vision. These observations support the theory of a germ cell tumor family, in which craniopharyngioma and germ cell tumor present the two sides of the same entity, while between them a wide variety of tumors, with variable type of secretion of AFP and/or beta-HCG, may exist.",cancer"Comparison of BD Surepath and ThinPrep Pap systems in the processing of mucus-rich specimens. BACKGROUND: Excessive mucus, as well as blood and inflammation, can be problematic in the processing and screening of liquid-based cervical Pap preparations by interfering in the process of cell retrieval onto specimen filters or slides. This study compares the capacity of the BD SurePath and ThinPrep liquid-based Papanicolaou (Pap) tests to handle mucus-laden specimens. METHODS: A 100 muL volume of pooled cervical epithelial cells was added to BD SurePath and ThinPrep liquid Pap test vials. Aliquots of cervical mucus that had been collected and pooled from previously processed mucus-rich Pap specimens were added to each series of test vials in amounts of 250 muL, 500 muL, 1000 muL, and 2000 muL. The vials were then routinely processed on their respective instruments and the test slides evaluated for cellularity of the squamous cell component. RESULTS: The BD SurePath test specimens showed no reduction of the squamous cell component resulting from the addition of any of the aliquots of mucus. The ThinPrep test specimens showed a marked loss of cellularity upon the addition of the first aliquot of mucus, with large areas of the filters showing nearly complete absence of squamous cells. CONCLUSIONS: Excessive mucus remains a potentially limiting factor in the ThinPrep Pap system. This appears to be the result of direct obstruction of the filtration membrane causing a markedly diminished retrieval of squamous epithelial cells and potentially impacting disease detection. The BD SurePath system, conversely, manages mucus by a cell enrichment process, which results in undiminished cell recovery as observed in this study's test conditions.",cancer"Antitumor effects and anticancer applications of bisphosphonates. Bisphosphonates are firmly entrenched in the treatment of metastatic bone disease secondary to several tumor types, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and myeloma. More recently, an emerging body of preclinical and clinical evidence indicates that bisphosphonates might also exhibit antitumor activity. This expanded role for bisphosphonates in the adjuvant setting might have profound clinical implications in many cancer types, particularly in the context of prevention of bone metastasis. Increased understanding of the mechanistic basis of the antitumor effects indicates that these might occur via direct mechanisms such as induction of apoptosis and inhibition of tumor cell adhesion and invasion, as well as indirect mechanisms such as inhibition of angiogenesis. There is also considerable evidence to suggest that nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates might exert additive or synergistic interactions with standard cytotoxic agents. However, mature clinical data with bisphosphonates are limited and, thus far, provide conflicting evidence regarding the antitumor role of bisphosphonates, but have mostly been conducted with first-generation bisphosphonates such as clodronate that are not as effective as next-generation bisphosphonates. Several large randomized clinical trials are ongoing with the next-generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid to prospectively confirm an antitumor role for bisphosphonates in various tumor types. This review assesses the current body of preclinical and clinical evidence in favor of an antitumor effect of bisphosphonates in different cancer types.",cancer"Examining the metastatic niche: targeting the microenvironment. Some of the most common cancer types, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and lung cancer, show a predilection to metastasize to bone. The molecular basis of this preferential growth of cancer cells in the bone microenvironment has been an area of active investigation. Although the precise molecular mechanisms underlying this process remain to be elucidated, it is now increasingly being recognized that the unique characteristics of the bone niche provide homing signals to cancer cells, and create a microenvironment conducive for the cancer cells to colonize. Concomitantly, cancer cells release several regulatory factors that result in abnormal bone destruction and/or formation. This complex bidirectional interplay between tumor cells and bone microenvironment establishes a ""vicious cycle"" that leads to a selective growth advantage for the cancer cells. The molecular insights gained on the underpinnings of bone metastasis in recent years have also provided us with avenues to devise innovative approaches for therapeutic intervention. The goal of this review is to describe our current understanding of molecular pathophysiology of cancer metastases to bone, as well as its therapeutic implications.",cancer"Implications of bone metastases and the benefits of bone-targeted therapy. Several cancers, including those originating in the breast, prostate, and lung, exhibit a propensity to metastasize to bone, resulting in debilitating skeletal complications. These sequelae, such as intractable pain, pathologic fractures, spinal compression, and hypercalcemia, greatly erode the patients' quality of life. Bisphosphonates, a class of antiresorptive drugs, are now the mainstay of the treatment of skeletal-related events in myeloma bone disease and many solid cancers with bone metastases. Current evidence indicates that newer-generation nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, particularly zoledronic acid, are potent inhibitors of bone resorption. In addition, increased understanding of the pathogenesis of bone metastasis has resulted in the development of several bone-targeted therapies including a monoclonal antibody targeting the receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB ligand (RANKL). In this review, clinical evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of currently available bone-targeted therapies including bisphosphonates and anti-RANKL monoclonal antibody in the treatment of bone metastasis due to breast cancer, prostate cancer, lung cancer, and multiple myeloma bone disease will be summarized.",cancer"Glycomics hits the big time. Cells run on carbohydrates. Glycans, sequences of carbohydrates conjugated to proteins and lipids, are arguably the most abundant and structurally diverse class of molecules in nature. Recent advances in glycomics reveal the scope and scale of their functional roles and their impact on human disease.",cancerOrbital inflammation after use of zoledronic acid for metastasized prostate carcinoma. Report of a case of orbital inflammation after the use of zoledronic acid for metastasized prostate cancer.,cancer"Diagnostic dilemmas of infantile sarcoma of the forearm. The authors present an interesting case of a suckling baby treated for forearm tumour. All the preoperative examinations including the imaging methods are documented, as are the surgical procedures and the final results. The case report is interesting not only because such surgery is infrequent but also due to the unpredictable progress of the final diagnosis statement. Before surgery the tumour was diagnosed as an organising haematoma; based on clinical and radiological signs the diagnosis subsequently rose to rapidly growing haemangioma or vascular malformation causing arm paresis and vascular supply disorder. The diagnosis was changed to angiolipoma during surgery. The final histopathological statement was: infantile fibrosarcoma. Despite the virtue of imaging methods and meticulous clinical examination, the surgical and histopathological findings are not necessarily absolutely identical. Having presented this particular case the authors would like to share their experience.",cancer"Nasal dermoids without intracranial extension in teenagers. BACKGROUND: Nasal dermoid cysts are benign, cystic midline masses. They contain mature tissues and often pocket hair, fat or sebum. Patients usually present with nasal enlargement or with a wide nasal dorsum with or without a fistula, causing an unacceptable cosmetic appearance. OBJECTIVE: To define a reliable surgical approach and method of removing dermoid with no intracranial extension in adolescent age. METHODS AND RESULTS: We retrospectively present diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in three teenagers ages 15, 17 and 18. All patients underwent prior surgeries at different hospitals. In the first case, the incision and exstirpation of the fistula's opening, followed by the fistula's canal, was performed. In the other two patients, the nasal dermoids were removed via the open approach with the transcollumelar incision. In all patients, we performed rhinoplasty with osteotomies to achieve an improved cosmetic effect. The esthetic results are presented. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of nasal swelling requires imaging. Total excision of the cyst is considered the casual treatment. The open rhinoplasty is an adequate method in patients with nasal dermoids without an intracranial extension. Experienced surgeons should manage the functional and esthetical aspects together during the same surgery.",cancer"Infection with human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV) among children with cancer in South Africa. BACKGROUND IN ADULTS,: HIV increases the risk of certain cancers known, or thought, to have an underlying infectious etiology; the impact on the risk of cancer in children is less clear. METHODS: Here, we report results of an on-going study at four pediatric oncology centers in South Africa in which children diagnosed with cancer are tested routinely for HIV. Odds ratios (OR) for the prevalence of various malignancies were calculated (with adjustment for age, sex, and center) for the children infected with HIV using all children with cancer and non-malignant conditions, but not infected with HIV, as a comparison group. RESULTS: Of 882 children with cancer, 38 were HIV infected (for 12 the HIV status was unknown). HIV was associated with Kaposi sarcoma (all 10 cases were HIV infected; P < 0.001) and with Burkitt lymphoma (OR = 46.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 16.4-130.3; 13/33). For non-Burkitt non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), 2/39 were HIV infected (OR = 5.0, 95% CI 0.9-27.0). No other cancer type was significantly associated with HIV, including lymphoid leukemias (OR = 0.4, 95% CI 0.04-2.9; 1/172). CONCLUSIONS: Only Kaposi sarcoma and Burkitt lymphoma were significantly associated with HIV infection although results for non-Burkitt NHL were suggestive. Notably, we did not identify an association between infection with HIV and lymphoid leukemias, for which an underlying infectious etiology has been suggested.",cancer"Metastatic tumors in the pancreas in the modern era. BACKGROUND: Tumors metastasizing to the pancreas are rare, and published series are limited by few patients treated for extended periods of time. Renal cell cancer (RCC) is the most common primary tumor metastasizing to the pancreas. Our aim was to describe the clinicopathologic characteristics and patient outcomes in a modern series of patients who underwent metastasectomy, with an emphasis on RCC. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of all pancreatic resections between January 1993 and October 2009. RESULTS: We identified 40 patients with a median age of 62 years; 55% were female. Patients most commonly presented with abdominal pain (47.5%). Operations performed included 10 pancreaticoduodenectomies, 1 middle, 23 distal, 3 total pancreatectomies, and 3 enucleations. Primary cancers were RCC (n = 20), ovarian (n = 6), sarcoma (n = 3), colon (n = 3), melanoma (n = 2), and others (n = 6). Median survival for all patients after metastasectomy was 4.4 years. Median survival after metastasectomy for RCC was 8.7 years, and the 5-year actuarial survival was 61%. For RCCs, pancreas was the first site of an extrarenal recurrence in 85% and was synchronous with the primary in 5% of patients. There was no survival difference if the time interval to metastasis was shorter than the median (8.7 years), if tumor nodules were multiple or bigger than the median (3 cm), or if the pancreas was not the first site of metastases. CONCLUSIONS: An aggressive approach to lesions metastatic to the pancreas is often warranted if the patient can be rendered free of disease. Although patients with RCC can experience long-term survival after metastasectomy, survival is less favorable for other primary tumors.",cancer"Therapeutic options in patients with early T stage and advanced N stage of tonsillar squamous cell carcinomas. OBJECTIVE: To compare the therapeutic role of surgery followed by radiotherapy (OPRT) and concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in patients with early T (T1/T2) and advanced N (N2/N3) stage tonsillar squamous cell carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Historical cohort study. SETTING: A tertiary hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The medical records of 42 patients who met the eligible criteria (24 patients were treated by OPRT, 18 patients by CCRT) were reviewed. RESULTS: Mean overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were 49.0 months and 43.0 months in OPRT group, respectively, and 39.6 months and 35.0 months in CCRT group, respectively (P = 0.18 for OS, P = 0.29 for DFS between the two groups). There was also no significant difference in survival estimates between OPRT and CCRT group in terms of two-year OS (P = 0.18) and two-year DFS (P = 0.45). In the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, the scores for global health status and symptom scales did not differ between the two groups. However, the OPRT group reported better functional scales and significantly higher scores for cognitive (P = 0.008) and social function (P = 0.03). Among single items, a significantly lower score for insomnia (P = 0.007) was noted in the OPRT group. In EORTC QLQ-H&N35 modules, there were no significantly different scales between the two groups except scores for nutritional supplements, in which the OPRT group presented lower symptom scores (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: OPRT could be still a viable option for managing selected cases of advanced oropharyngeal cancer because one can expect comparable therapeutic outcome as well as quality of life.",cancer"Spanish validation of the University of Washington Quality of Life questionnaire for head and neck cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: The University of Washington Quality of Life (UW-QOL) questionnaire is one of the most widely used instruments to evaluate the quality of life of head and neck cancer patients. The aim of this study was to perform a Spanish translation and validation of the UW-QOL questionnaire. STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. SETTING: Three tertiary-care hospitals and a laryngectomee rehabilitation center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The translation and cultural adaptation of the questionnaire were performed following accepted international guidelines. The psychometric validation was performed on a consecutive series of patients treated for squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract with no signs of relapse, recruited from May 2007 to December 2008. Eligible subjects were invited to complete the Spanish version of the UW-QOL questionnaire during routine clinical consultation, and complete it again within 15 days. Subjects also completed a validated Spanish version of the Goldberg Mental Health Survey and were evaluated by the use of the Karnofsky Index. RESULTS: A Spanish version of the questionnaire was developed in iterative fashion. In the psychometric validation process, a total of 76 patients were analyzed. Reliability was excellent, including both internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha of 0.84) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient between 0.91 and 0.97 with a confidence interval of 95%). Construct validity was supported by statistically significant relationships between the Karnofsky Index, the Goldberg Mental Health Survey, and the translated UW-QOL questionnaire. CONCLUSION: The Spanish version of the UW-QOL questionnaire appears to be culturally appropriate and psychometrically valid.",cancer"Correlation of biomarkers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters, including choline/creatine ratio (Cho/Cr) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) with protein expression of 10 common tumor and prognostic markers in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: University hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: The Cho/Cr and ADC obtained from 74 patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma were correlated with the expression level of the 10 protein markers as determined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Cho/Cr showed significant positive correlations with cyclooxygenase 2 in primary tumors (r = 0.714), and epidermal growth factor receptor in metastatic cervical lymph nodes (r = 0.522). ADC showed significant (r = -0.591) negative correlation with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 in metastatic cervical lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: There are relationships between protein and functional MRI markers. Future research in this direction may improve our understanding of the cancer micro-environment.",cancer"Children with acute leukemia: a comparison of outcomes from allogeneic blood stem cell and bone marrow transplantation. BACKGROUND: The relative merits of peripheral blood stem-cell transplantation (PBSCT) versus bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for children with standard and high-risk hematologic malignancies remain unclear. In a retrospective study, we compared allogeneic PBSCT (n = 30) with BMT (n = 110) in children with acute leukemia between January 2001 and September 2006. PROCEDURE: Median age for PBSCT was 9 years versus 8 years for BMT. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the demographic and medical variables. The unadjusted probabilities of disease-free survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The association of graft-source and time to each of the study endpoints was estimated by Cox's regression model and the occurrence of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) was included as a time-dependent covariate. RESULTS: Time to neutrophil engraftment and platelet independence was faster after PBSCT than BMT (neutrophils 15.0 days vs. 17.0 days, P < 0.001; platelets, 21.0 days vs. 27.0 days, P = 0.034). The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV acute GvHD at 100 days was 10.4% (SE 5.6%) after PBSCT and 15.1% (SE 3.5%) after BMT (P = NS). The cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD was 13.8% (SE 6.3%) after PBSCT and 11.3% (SE 3.1%) after BMT (P = NS). One-year disease-free survival was 37.9% (SE 9.0%) for PBSCT recipients versus 65.1% (SE 4.6%) after BMT (P = 0.005) but this difference was not sustained in multivariate analysis. Thus, only disease risk and pre-transplant CMV seropositivity were significant predictors of disease-free survival. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that PBSCT for children produces faster engraftment without increased risk of acute or chronic GvHD.",cancer"Retrospective analysis of pediatric cancer patients diagnosed with the pandemic H1N1 influenza infection. BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on disease characteristics and outcome of children with cancer who contracted the H1N1 influenza infection during the 2009 pandemic. METHODS: All 76 pediatric patients with cancer and documented H1N1 infection who presented to the Pediatric Department at King Hussein Cancer Center (KHCC) between October 1 and December 1, 2009 were reviewed for clinical characteristics and course of the disease. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the patients had hematological malignancies and half were receiving non-intensive chemotherapy at the time of infection. With the exception of two patients who needed pediatric intensive care unit admission, the course of the remaining patients was uneventful whether they were hospitalized or not. No deaths related to H1N1 influenza infection were reported. Sixty-three percent of patients became afebrile within 48 hr of receiving oseltamivir. One-third of hospitalized patients were discharged in < 3 days. CONCLUSION: The course of H1N1 influenza infection in children with cancer appears to be mild in most cases.",cancer"Delay and causes of delay in the diagnosis of childhood cancer in Africa. BACKGROUND: Although a few studies have investigated delays in diagnosis and treatment among children and adolescents with cancer, this has never been subject of study in South Africa. Early diagnosis is fundamental as it allows timely treatment and prevents unnecessary complications. PROCEDURES: Combined prospective and retrospective study of 194 children with cancer at Tygerberg Hospital, Cape Town, diagnosed between 2000 and 2009: 126 patients were included through review of the medical charts and 68 through interviews with the parents. RESULTS: The median total diagnosis delay was 34 days (2-1,826). The median patient delay was 5 days (0-457). The median physician delay was 20 days (0-924). Gender, age or ethnicity of the children, as well as parental level of education did not have a significant influence on the total time to diagnosis. Initial misdiagnoses were frequent (58%). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable delay in diagnosing childhood cancer in the area served by Tygerberg Hospital, due mostly to a physician delay of 20 days on average. The findings of our unit should be correlated with other South African centers. There is a clear need to increase parental awareness of childhood cancer and to intensify the education of nurses and doctors with regard to the warning signs of the disease.",cancer"Incidence of childhood central nervous system tumors in the Nordic countries. BACKGROUND: The incidence rates of childhood central nervous system (CNS) tumors in the Nordic countries remain among the highest in the world. Large geographical and temporal variations in the incidence rates of CNS tumors have been reported. Increasing incidence rates would be a public health concern, as they might indicate increased exposure to environmental risk factors. METHODS: All 3,983 children 0-14 years of age registered with a primary CNS tumor in 1985-2006 in the national cancer registries of the Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden were identified. Tumors were classified according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer version 3 (ICCC-3). Join-point analysis was used to detect changes in trends and to estimate annual changes in incidence rates. RESULTS: The mean annual incidence rate of CNS tumors was 42 per million. No statistically significant change in time trends of incidence rates was observed during 1985-2006. Furthermore, the incidence by birth cohort was relatively stable during the study period. CONCLUSION: The incidence rates of childhood CNS tumors in the Nordic countries remain among the highest in the world. The stable incidence rates during the last 22 years indicate that major changes in environmental risk factors are unlikely.",cancer"Childhood leukemia incidence in Brazil according to different geographical regions. BACKGROUND: Resource-rich countries tend to have a higher incidence of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), whereas lower rates are seen in more deprived countries. This study describes the incidence of childhood acute leukemia in Brazil, an upper middle-income country, based on data from 16 population-based cancer registries (PBCRs). PROCEDURE: Data were examined from 16 PBCRs in Brazilian cities located in five geographical regions during the period from 1997 to 2004. Incidence rates were analyzed according to gender, age, and type of leukemia. The Wilcoxon test was performed to evaluate for gender-age based difference between by leukemia type. RESULTS: The median age-adjusted incidence rate (AAIR) of leukemia in children aged 0-14 years old was 53.3 per million. A different AAIR was found regarding ALL and myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) that ranged from 24.8 to 76.84 per 1,000,000 children. Manaus, although located in a poor area of Brazil, exhibited the highest AAIR (56.6 per million) of ALL. Goiania had the highest AAIR (24.5 per million) of MPD. The median age-specific incidence rate (ASIR) for the 16 Brazilian PBCRs demonstrated a marked peak in incidence of ALL at age 3 years old, in both genders. CONCLUSIONS: This population-based study of childhood leukemia demonstrates that substantial regional differences exist regarding the incidence of acute leukemia in Brazil, which warrants further ecological study.",cancer"Incidence, survival, and prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors versus neuroblastoma in children and young adults: nine standard SEER registries, 1975-2006. BACKGROUND: The incidence, survival, and prevalence of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in children were determined as a first step in improving diagnosis and therapy. Outcomes were compared with neuroblastoma, a pediatric malignancy that shares several biomarkers. METHODS: Incidence rates, observed survival rates and 31-year limited duration prevalence counts were obtained from SEER*Stat for diagnosis years 1975 to 2006. These rates were compared between and within NETs and neuroblastoma for demographic and tumor-related variables from nine standard SEER registries for ages 0-29 years. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to identify prognostic factors for survival in NETs. RESULTS: The number of NETs was 1,073 compared to 1,664 neuroblastomas. The most common NET sites were lung, breast, and appendix. NET 5-year observed survival rates increased from 83% between 1975 and 1979 to 84% for the 2000-2006 period, while analogous neuroblastoma survival rates steadily increased from 45-73%. Five-year observed survival was less than 30% in females with NETs of the cervix and ovary. The estimated 31-year limited duration prevalence for NETs as of January 1, 2006 in the U.S. population was 7,724 compared to 9,960 for neuroblastomas. Age-adjusted multivariate Cox Regression demonstrated small cell histology, primary location in the breast, and distant stage as major predictors of decreased survival. CONCLUSIONS: While survivorship has significantly increased for neuroblastoma, those diagnosed with NETs have shown no increase in survival during this 31-year period. NETs constitute an unrecognized cancer threat to children and young adults comparable to neuroblastoma in both number of affected persons and disease severity.",cancer"A phase II study of metronomic oral topotecan for recurrent childhood brain tumors. BACKGROUND: The prognosis for recurrent or refractory brain tumors in children is poor with conventional therapies. Topotecan is a topoisomerase I inhibitor with good central nervous system (CNS) penetration following oral administration. Increased efficacy of topotecan has been demonstrated with prolonged low-dose daily treatment in pre-clinical models. To investigate further this drug delivered orally in pediatric CNS malignancies, a phase II study in children with recurrent or refractory brain tumors was performed. PROCEDURE: Patients </= 21 years of age at diagnosis with a recurrent, progressive, or refractory primary CNS malignancy and measurable disease, were eligible. Patients enrolled into four strata: ependymoma (N = 4), high-grade glioma (HGG) (N = 6), brainstem glioma (BSG) (N = 13), and primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) (N = 8). Oral topotecan was administered once daily at a dose of 0.8 mg/m(2)/day for 21 consecutive days repeated every 28 days. Response and toxicity profiles were evaluated. RESULTS: Twenty-six patients were evaluable (median age 9.2 years; 10 males). Two objective responses were observed in PNET patients with disseminated tumor at study entry. These two patients remain alive and in remission 7 and 9.5 years off study. Four other patients (two BSG, one PNET, and one HGG) had stable disease (median 4.6 months). The most common toxicities were hematologic. CONCLUSIONS: Daily oral topotecan at a dose of 0.8 mg/m(2)/day can be safely administered to children with recurrent or refractory brain tumors. This regimen identified activity in recurrent PNET. The prolonged progression free survival (PFS) in two PNET patients justifies consideration of this regimen in more advanced clinical trials.",cancer"Spectrum of SMARCB1/INI1 mutations in familial and sporadic rhabdoid tumors. BACKGROUND: Germline mutations and deletions of SMARCB1/INI1 in chromosome band 22q11.2 predispose patients to rhabdoid tumor and schwannomatosis. Previous estimates suggested that 15-20% of rhabdoid tumors were caused by an underlying germline abnormality of SMARCB1. However, these studies were limited by case selection and an inability to detect intragenic deletions and duplications. PROCEDURE: One hundred matched tumor and blood samples from patients with rhabdoid tumors of the brain, kidney, or soft tissues were analyzed for mutations and deletions of SMARCB1 by FISH, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), sequence analysis and high resolution Illumina 610K SNP-based oligonucleotide array studies. RESULTS: Thirty-five of 100 patients were found to have a germline SMARCB1 abnormality. These abnormalities included point and frameshift mutations, intragenic deletions and duplications, and larger deletions including regions both proximal and distal to SMARCB1. There were nine cases that demonstrated parent to child transmission of a mutated copy of SMARCB1. In eight of the nine cases, one or more family members were also diagnosed with rhabdoid tumor or schwannoma, and two of the eight families presented with multiple affected children in a manner consistent with gonadal mosaicism. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately one-third of newly diagnosed patients with rhabdoid tumor have an underlying genetic predisposition to tumors due to a germline SMARCB1 alteration. Families may demonstrate incomplete penetrance and gonadal mosaicism, which must be considered when counseling families of patients with rhabdoid tumor.",cancer"Masitinib for the treatment of systemic and cutaneous mastocytosis with handicap: a phase 2a study. Treatment options for patients suffering from indolent forms of mastocytosis remain inadequate with the hyperactivation of mast cells responsible for many of the disease's systemic manifestations. Masitinib is a potent and highly selective oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor. A combined inhibition of c-Kit and Lyn make it particularly efficient in controlling the activity of mast cells and therefore, of potential therapeutic benefit in mastocytosis. Masitinib was administered to 25 patients diagnosed as having systemic or cutaneous mastocytosis with related handicap (i.e., disabilities associated with flushes, depression, pruritus and quality-of-life) at the initial dose levels of 3 or 6 mg/kg/day over 12 weeks. In accordance with the AFIRMM study, response was based upon change of clinical symptoms associated with patient handicap at week 12 relative to baseline, regardless of disease subtype. Improvement was observed in all primary endpoints at week 12 including a reduction of flushes, Hamilton rating, and pruritus as compared with baseline by 64% (P = 0.0005), 43% (P = 0.0049), and 36% (P = 0.0077), respectively. An overall clinical response was observed in 14/25 patients (56%; [95%CI = 37%-75%]), with sustainable improvement observed throughout an extension phase (>60 weeks). Common adverse events were edema (44%), nausea (44%), muscle spasms (28%), and rash (28%), the majority of which were of mild or moderate severity with a significant decline in frequency observed after 12 weeks of treatment. One patient experienced a serious adverse event of reversible agranulocytosis. Masitinib is a promising treatment for indolent forms of mastocytosis with handicap and indicates acceptable tolerability for long-term treatment regimens.",cancer"A comparison of radiotherapy with radiotherapy plus surgery for brain metastases from urinary bladder cancer: analysis of 62 patients. PURPOSE: To evaluate the role of radiotherapy (RT) and prognostic factors in 62 patients with brain metastases from transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 62 patients received either RT (n = 49), including whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), or surgery (OP) combined with WBRT (n = 13). Overall survival (OS), intracerebral control (ICC) and local control (LC) were retrospectively analyzed. Six potential prognostic factors were assessed: age, gender, number of brain metastases, extracerebral metastases, recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) class, and interval from tumor diagnosis to RT. RESULTS: Median OS and ICC for the entire cohort were 9 and 7 months. No significant difference between RT and OP + RT was found for OS (p = 0.696) and ICC (p = 0.996). On multivariate analysis, improved OS was associated with lack of extracerebral metastases (p < 0.001) and RPA class (p < 0.001), and ICC with the latter (p < 0.001). SRS-incorporating RT resulted in 1-, 2-, and 3-year LC probability of 78%, 66%, and 51%. No association between LC and any of the potential prognostic factors was observed. The results of the subgroup RPA class analyses were similar to the entire cohort. CONCLUSION: Patient outcome for the RT-alone arm was not significantly different from OP + RT. SRS-incorporating treatment offers excellent LC rates. RPA class and the presence of extracerebral metastases demonstrated a significant prognostic role for survival. The latter should be used as stratification factors in randomized trials and can help define the cohort of patients that may benefit from more aggressive therapies.",cancer"Radiofrequency ablation for benign aldosterone-producing adenoma: a scarless technique to an old disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in treating primary aldosteronism (PA) due to aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA). BACKGROUND: Radiofrequency ablation is an established technique for treating malignant solid organ neoplasm. Its application on benign functional adrenal adenoma has never been prospectively described. METHODS: We prospectively evaluated a patient cohort with computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous RFA performed on functional APA of size 4 cm or less. Treatment success was defined as complete tumor ablation on follow-up CT scan plus normalization of serum aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) at 3 to 6 months after RFA. Salvage laparoscopic adrenalectomy was offered to patients who had failed RFA and remained hypertensive. RESULTS: Between August 2004 and August 2008, 28 patients were referred for the procedure. Radiofrequency ablation was not performed on 4 APA because of their close proximity to major vascular structures. Twenty-four patients (11 men and 13 women) with a median age of 51.5 (range = 34-63) years underwent RFA for 11 right and 13 left APA. The median tumor diameter was 16.0 (range = 4.0-25.0) mm. There was no periprocedure hypertensive crisis or major morbidity or mortality. Minor complications occurred in 4 patients (16.7%), including 1 small pneumothorax and 3 retroperitoneal hematomas (< 3 cm), which all resolved on conservative treatment. At 3 to 6 months of follow-up, CT scan showed complete tumor ablation in all patients (100%). Primary aldosteronism was biochemically resolved in 23 patients (95.8%). Salvage adrenalectomy was not performed in the single failed patient, as she remained normotensive on repeated follow-up. The overall success rate of RFA was 95.8%. CONCLUSIONS: Computed tomography-guided percutaneous RFA is a safe and efficacious alternative to laparoscopic adrenalectomy in treating patients with PA due to small APA.",cancer"Pure desmoplastic melanoma: a melanoma with distinctive clinical behavior. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the excision margin necessary for desmoplastic melanoma (DM). BACKGROUND: DM consists of 2 histologic subtypes, pure DM (PDM) and mixed DM (MDM), differing in extent of fibrotic component. We investigated clinical and therapeutic determinants of prognosis in these DM entities. METHODS: We reviewed 118 PDM and 124 MDM treated at our Institute over 25 years. Local relapse, distant metastasis, and survival were studied. RESULTS: Most (91.7%) distant metastases in PDM developed after 1 or more local recurrences; whereas distant metastasis usually (79.6%) occurred as first event in MDM. Overall mortality trends in relation to lesion-thickness-plus-excision-width differed for PDM (P = 0.014) but not MDM (P = 0.185). For PDM, 5-year crude cumulative incidence (CCI) of mortality was higher (40.0%) for thin tumors (</= 2 mm thick) excised with 1 cm margin than those excised with 2 cm (14.8%); CCI of mortality for PDM > 2 mm thick excised with 2 cm margins (13.4%) was similar to that for thin PDM lesions excised with 2 cm (14.8%). CCI of local recurrence was also greater in PDM excised with 1 cm margins. In MDM, mortality increased with stage but was independent of excision width (CCI: 29.4% for </= 2 mm/2 cm, 31.3% for </= 2 mm/1 cm, and 48.3% for > 2 mm/2 cm); a similar trend was found for MDM distant metastases. CONCLUSIONS: In PDM, limited excision width is associated with significantly greater local recurrence and mortality; treatment should be excision with 2 cm margins even for thin lesions. MDM behaves similarly to other melanomas; treatment should follow guidelines on melanoma management.",cancer"B7-h3 ligand expression by primary breast cancer and associated with regional nodal metastasis. OBJECTIVE: : B7 ligand family members have been shown to be important immunoregulatory factors in host tumor immune responses. We hypothesized that B7-H3, a coinhibitory factor, is expressed by primary breast cancer cells and associated with metastasis to regional tumor-draining lymph nodes. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: : American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to III primary breast cancers (n = 82) and normal breast specimens (n = 17) were assessed for B7-H3 expression using paraffin-embedded archival tissues. B7-H3 expression by breast cancer cells was assessed by a quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and B7-H3 protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: : B7-H3 mRNA expression was detected in 32 of 82 (39%) primary breast tumors but not in normal breast tissues (P = 0.0029). B7-H3 expression in primary tumors significantly correlated with increasing tumor size, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage, and lymphovascular invasion (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, P = 0.0071). B7-H3 expression was highly correlated to sentinel lymph node and overall number of lymph nodes with metastasis P = 0.003, and P = 0.004, respectively). In a multivariate analysis, B7-H3 mRNA expression of the primary tumor significantly predicted metastasis to regional lymph nodes (P = 0.021, and P = 0.023, respectively). Antibody staining analysis of paraffin-embedded archival tissue breast tumors and flow cytometry of breast cancer cell lines demonstrated B7-H3 protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: : B7-H3 protein expressed by primary breast cancer cells is a tumor progression factor and is associated with extent of regional nodal metastasis.",cancer"Does hepatic pedicle clamping affect disease-free survival following liver resection for colorectal metastases? OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of liver ischemia from hepatic pedicle clamping (HPC) on long-term outcome after hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases (CRLM). BACKGROUND: Liver resection offers the only chance of cure for patients with CRLM. Several clinical and pathologic factors have been reported as determinants of poor outcome after hepatectomy for CRLM. A controversial issue is that hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury from HPC may adversely affect long-term outcome by accelerating the outgrowth of residual hepatic micrometastases. METHODS: Patients undergoing liver resection for CRLM in 2 tertiary referral centers, between 1992 and 2008, were included. Disease-free survival and specific liver-free survival were analyzed according to the use, type, and duration of HPC. RESULTS: Five hundred forty-three patients had primary hepatectomy for CRLM. Hepatic pedicle clamping was performed in 355 patients (65.4%), and intermittently applied in 254 patients (71.5%). Postoperative mortality and morbidity rates were 1.3% and 18.5%, respectively. Hepatic pedicle clamping had a highly significant impact in reducing the risk of blood transfusions and was not correlated with significantly higher postoperative morbidity. Liver recurrence rate was not significantly different according to the use, type, and duration of HPC, in patients resected after preoperative chemotherapy as well. On univariate analysis, HPC did not significantly affect overall and disease-free survival. These results were confirmed on the multivariate analysis where blood transfusions, primary tumor nodal involvement, and the size of CRLM of more than 5 cm prevailed as determinants of poor outcome. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the safety and effectiveness of HPC and demonstrates that in the human situation, there is no evidence that HPC may adversely affect long-term outcome after hepatectomy for CRLM.",cancer"Intraoperative bacterial translocation detected by bacterium-specific ribosomal rna-targeted reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for the mesenteric lymph node strongly predicts postoperative infectious complications after major hepatectomy for biliary malignancies. BACKGROUND: There is little evidence indicating a causal linkage between bacterial translocation and postoperative infectious complication (POIC) in human studies. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the correlation between the occurrence of bacterial translocation in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) and POIC with a sensitive quantitative method using bacterium-specific ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-targeted reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). METHODS: Patients who underwent major hepatectomy for biliary malignancies involving hepatic hilus were included in this study (n = 65). Mesenteric lymph nodes were harvested from the jejunal mesentery 2 times during the operation (MLN-1 harvested at laparotomy and MLN-2 harvested after tumor resection). Microorganisms were detected by a bacterium-specific rRNA-targeted RT-qPCR method. Perioperative factors and POIC were recorded prospectively. RESULTS: Of 65 patients, 51 completed the study. Microorganisms were detected in MLN-1 and MLN-2 in 15 (29.4%) and 19 (37.3%) patients, respectively. The detection of microorganisms in MLN-1 was significantly correlated with the incidence of preoperative cholangitis (P = 0.04), whereas the detection of microorganisms in MLN-2 was significantly correlated with the incidence of POIC (P = 0.002). In multivariate analysis, a positive result for detection of microorganisms in MLN-2 was one of the independent predictive factors of POIC (odds ratio = 26.1). CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative analysis of MLNs (especially MLN-2) by rRNA-targeted RT-qPCR can strongly predict the occurrence of POIC after hepatectomy for biliary malignancy. This method is more sensitive and faster at detection of microorganisms than the conventional culture method. Therefore, we can obtain the information of bacterial translocation immediately after the surgery and can select the group of patients with high risk for POIC.",cancer"Laparoscopic resection of colorectal liver metastases: surgical and long-term oncologic outcome. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the immediate and long-term outcome after laparoscopic resection of colorectal liver metastases and difference between observed and predicted [Fong's and Basingstoke Predictive Index (BPI) scores] survivals. BACKGROUND: : Laparoscopic liver resection has been reported safe and feasible and improves postoperative course. The oncologic outcomes after resection of colorectal metastases are poorly reported. METHODS: Between August 1998 and January 2010, 122 patients underwent laparoscopic resection for colorectal liver metastases during 135 procedures at Rikshospitalet. Patients undergoing surgery between August 1998 and June 2009 were included in research analysis. The patients had median Fong's and BPI's scores of 2 (0-5) and 7 (0-23), respectively. Mainstream analysis of hospital data was done on intent-to-treat basis. Intraoperative incidents and postoperative complications were analyzed according to the Satava and Clavien-Dindo classifications. Median follow-up was 24 (0-100) months. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one liver resections were performed in 107 patients during 118 procedures: 117 nonanatomic and 34 anatomic liver resections. There were 5 conversions to laparotomy (4.2%). The resection margin was free of tumor tissue in 141 (93.4%) of 151 specimens, and the distance between the resection margin and tumor tissue was median 6 (0-40) mm. Intraoperative incidents occurred in 14 cases (11.9%), including 5 (4.2%), 8 (6.8%), and 1 (0.8%) cases of grades I, II, and III, respectively. Postoperative complications were observed in 16 cases (14.3%), including 2, 3, 7, 3, 0, and 1 cases of grades I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, and V, respectively. During follow-up, 21 patients received repeat liver resection of recurrences (11 by laparoscopy and 10 by laparotomy). The 5-year overall survival rates were 51% as laparoscopically completed cases and 47% as intent-to-treat. The observed actuarial survival values exceeded the values expected by Fong's and BPI's score, with 10.2% and 6.7% as laparoscopically completed cases and with 3.8% and 2.4% as intent-to-treat, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic resection is a favorable alternative to open liver resection for patients with colorectal liver metastases. The observed actuarial survival values after laparoscopic resection surpass the values expected by major scoring systems.",cancer"Pathologic complete response of primary tumor following preoperative chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer: long-term outcomes and prognostic significance of pathologic nodal status (KROG 09-01). OBJECTIVE: To investigate long-term outcomes of locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients with postchemoradiotherapy (post-CRT) pathologic complete response of primary tumor (ypT0) and determine prognostic significance of post-CRT pathologic nodal (ypN) status. BACKGROUND: LARC patients with post-CRT pathologic complete response were suggested to have favorable long-term outcomes, but prognostic significance of ypN status has never been specifically defined in ypT0 patients. METHODS: The Korean Radiation Oncology Group collected clinical data for 333 LARC patients with ypT0 following preoperative CRT and curative radical resections between 1993 and 2007. Sphincter preservation surgery and abdominoperineal resection were performed in 283 (85.0%) and 50 (15.0%) patients, respectively. Postoperative chemotherapy was given to 285 (85.6%) patients. Survival was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and the Cox proportional hazard model was used in multivariate analyses. RESULTS: After median follow-up of 43 (range = 14-172) months, 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) was 84.6% and overall survival (OS) was 92.8%. The ypN status was ypT0N0 in 304 (91.3%), ypT0N1 in 22 (6.6%), and ypT0N2 in 7 (2.1%) patients. The ypN status was the most relevant independent prognostic factor for both DFS and OS in ypT0 patients. The 5-year DFS and OS was 88.5% and 94.8% in ypT0N0 patients, and 45.2% and 72.8% in ypT0N+ patients (both, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: LARC patients achieving ypT0N0 after preoperative CRT had favorable long-term outcomes, whereas positive ypN status had a poor prognosis even after total regression of primary tumor.",cancer"Elastica staining for venous invasion results in superior prediction of cancer-specific survival in colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To examine the prognostic implications of routine elastica staining for venous invasion on prediction of cancer-specific survival in colorectal cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Venous invasion is an important high risk feature in colorectal cancer, although prevalence in published studies ranges from 10% to 90%. To resolve the disparity, elastica stains have been used in our institution to provide a more objective judgment since 2002. METHODS: The study included 419 patients undergoing curative elective colorectal cancer resection between 1997 and 2006. Patients were grouped prior to (1997-2001 [cohort 1]) and following the introduction of elastica staining (2003-2006 [cohort 2]). FINDINGS: Clinicopathologic characteristics and 3-year survival rates were similar in both groups. Rate of detected venous invasion increased from 18% to 58% following introduction of elastica staining (P < 0.001). The 3-year cancer-specific survival rate associated with the absence of venous invasion was 84% in cohort 1, compared with 96% in cohort 2 (P < 0.01). Elastica staining improved the prognostic value of venous invasion, showing the area under the receiver operator curve rising from 0.59 (P = 0.040; 1997-2001) to 0.68 (P < 0.001; 2003-2006), using cancer mortality as an end point. A direct comparison between H&E alone and elastica Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) was made in 53 patients. The area under the receiver operator curve increased from 0.58, P = 0.293 (H&E alone) to 0.74, P = 0.003 for venous invasion detected using the elastica method. CONCLUSIONS: Increased detection of venous invasion with elastica staining, compared with H&E staining, provides superior prediction of cancer survival in colorectal cancer. This relationship was seen in the comparison of 2 consecutive cohorts and in a direct comparison in a single cohort. Based on these results, elastica staining should be incorporated into the routine pathologic assessment of venous invasion in colorectal cancer.",cancer"Factors predicting the quality of total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: To determine preoperative tumor-, patient-, and treatment-related factors that are independently associated with incomplete mesorectal excision. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Incomplete total mesorectal excision (TME) for rectal cancer is associated with increased local and overall recurrences. Factors predicting incomplete mesorectal excision have scarcely been studied. METHODS: In the context of PROCARE, a Belgian multidisciplinary project on rectal cancer, the quality of 266 consecutive and anonymized TME specimens submitted by 33 candidate-TME-trainers was graded by a blinded pathology review board in a standardized manner. Uni- and multivariable analysis were performed to identify factors that can independently predict incomplete mesorectal excision. RESULTS: Mesorectal resection was complete in 21%, nearly complete in 47%, and incomplete in 32%. Of 57% of TME specimens the grade of resection had not been reported by the local pathologist. Incomplete TME doubled the incidence of a positive circumferential resection margin (P = 0.004). Factors found to be significantly related to incomplete TME in univariate analysis were as follows: surgeon, female gender, pathologic body mass index, low rectal cancer, negative clinical nodal status, the absence of downstaging after long-course chemoradiation, laparoscopic and converted laparoscopic resection, and abdominoperineal resection. Multivariable analysis identified pathologic body mass index (P = 0.017), the absence of downstaging after long-course chemoradiation (P = 0.0005), and laparoscopic or converted laparoscopic resection (P = 0.014) as factors that are independently associated with incomplete mesorectal excision. CONCLUSION: Good TME quality cannot be guaranteed. This peer-reviewed TME assessment revealed a number of factors that are independently related to incomplete TME. Both specimen and pathology report need to be audited.",cancer"A randomized trial comparing radiofrequency ablation and surgical resection for HCC conforming to the Milan criteria. OBJECTIVE: To compare the long-term outcomes of surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a promising, emerging therapy for small HCC. Whether it is as effective as surgical resection (RES) for long-term outcomes is still indefinite. METHODS: Two hundred thirty HCC patients who met the Milan criteria and were suitable to be treated by either RES or RFA entered into a randomized controlled trial. The patients were regularly followed up after treatment for 5 years (except for those who died). The primary end point was overall survival; the secondary end points were recurrence-free survival, overall recurrence, and early-stage recurrence. RESULTS: The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-year overall survival rates for the RFA group and the RES group were 86.96%, 76.52%, 69.57%, 66.09%, 54.78% and 98.26%, 96.52%, 92.17%, 82.60%, 75.65%, respectively. The corresponding recurrence-free survival rates for the 2 groups were 81.74%, 59.13%, 46.08%, 33.91%, 28.69% and 85.22%, 73.92%, 60.87%, 54.78%, 51.30%, respectively. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival were significantly lower in the RFA group than in the RES group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.017). The 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-year overall recurrence rates were 16.52%, 38.26%, 49.57%, 59.13%, and 63.48% for the RFA group and 12.17%, 22.60%, 33.91%, 39.13%, and 41.74% for the RES group. The overall recurrence was higher in the RFA group than in the RES group (P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection may provide better survival and lower recurrence rates than RFA for patients with HCC to the Milan criteria.",cancer"Thyroid transcription factor-1 expression in breast carcinomas. Immunostaining for thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is frequently used to help assess the site of origin of metastatic carcinomas. TTF-1 expression is most frequently seen in carcinomas of thyroid and lung origin. Furthermore, it has been assumed that the expression of TTF-1 in a carcinoma excludes the possibility of a breast origin. We have recently encountered in our consultation practice 4 cases of invasive breast carcinoma (confirmed by clinical findings and other immunophenotypic features) that showed unequivocal tumor cell expression of TTF-1. However, the frequency with which TTF-1 expression is observed in breast carcinomas is unknown. To address this, we carried out immunostaining for TTF-1 on 546 primary breast carcinomas submitted for routine estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and/or HER2 testing. Cases were considered TTF-1 positive if they showed any nuclear staining for this marker. TTF-1 expression was identified in 13 cases (2.4%). Expression varied from focal and weak to diffuse and strong and was seen in both invasive and in situ components. We conclude that a small proportion of breast carcinomas show TTF-1 expression. Therefore, the presence of TTF-1 immunoreactivity in a carcinoma cannot by itself be used to exclude the possibility of a breast origin.",cancer"Macroscopic sertoli cell nodule: a study of 6 cases that presented as testicular masses. Sertoli cell nodules are almost always incidental microscopic lesions found in both cryptorchid and normally descended testes. Sertoli cell nodules, when present as masses or ultrasonographic lesions, may create diagnostic confusion. Herein, we report 6 cases of macroscopic Sertoli cell nodules that were received in consultation. The referral diagnoses included Sertoli cell tumor (2 cases), sex cord tumor with annular tubules (1 case), and gonadoblastoma (1 case). The patients were 19 to 36 years old: 3 patients presented with palpable testicular masses and 3 with lesions that were worrisome for neoplasms in ultrasonographic examinations conducted for pain (2 cases) or infertility (1 case). All were phenotypically normal male patients who lacked endocrine symptoms. The Sertoli cell nodules ranged from 6 to 10 mm in diameter and on microscopic examination consisted of circumscribed proliferations of immature Sertoli cells, globules and trabeculae of basement membrane, and spermatogonia in varying proportions. In 2 cases the lesion was distinctly intratubular, consisting of closely packed tubules containing various components; in the other cases there was confluent growth of the tubules. Immunostains for alpha-inhibin highlighted the Sertoli cells (5 of 5 cases), with the germ cells appearing in negative relief. An antibody for testis-specific protein, Y-encoded (TSPY), stained the spermatogonia (2 of 2 cases), whereas OCT 3/4 was negative in all the cases (5 of 5 cases). We conclude that Sertoli cell nodules may present clinically as mass lesions, and that it is important to distinguish them from true neoplasms to avoid unnecessary procedures.",cancer"Expression of Her-2 in carcinomas of the esophagus. The human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 gene (HER-2) encodes for a membrane-bound tyrosine kinase (Her-2), which is overexpressed in various human cancers. Her-2-targeted therapy has recently been shown to be beneficial for patients with advanced gastric cancer. Her-2 protein expression was investigated in 341 esophageal carcinomas [152 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 189 adenocarcinomas (AC)], 39 cases of Barrett mucosa, and 11 cases of squamous cell dysplasia. HER-2 gene amplification was assessed by colorimetric in-situ hybridization. Positive Her-2 status was found in 15.3% of ACs and 3.9% of SCCs. Positive Her-2-status was more common in dysplastic Barrett mucosas compared with nondysplastic ones (P=0.04). In 26% of the patients with ACs who had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=39), the Her-2 status of pretherapeutic biopsies was different compared with subsequent surgical specimens. There was no statistically significant correlation between Her-2 status and patients' survival. Although Her-2 overexpression is rare in SCCs, it is found in 15.3% of ACs, where amplification of HER-2 gene and overexpression of Her-2 protein seem to be early events in carcinogenesis. The evaluation of Her-2 status in tumor biopsies and in particular in the context with possible alterations after neoadjuvant treatment can potentially lead to false Her-2-staging. Although Her-2-overexpression in esophageal cancer seems to have no influence on patients' survival, these subtypes of esophageal ACs have to be considered as targets for an anti-Her-2 therapy.",cancer"Prostate cancer topography and patterns of lymph node metastasis. Pelvic lymph node (LN) metastasis is a well-recognized route of prostate cancer spread. However, the relationship between topography and the pathologic features of primary prostatic cancers and patterns of pelvic LN metastasis has not been well studied. We reviewed original slides of radical prostatectomies and pelvic LN dissections from 125 patients with LN metastasis and recorded a total number of LN excised/laterality of positive LN, and localization, staging parameters, lymphovascular invasion, and volume of primary tumors. LN QUANTITY AND DISTRIBUTION: 14.6 (mean) and 13 (median) LNs were resected. Seventy-six (61%), 33 (26%), and 16 (13%) cases had 1, 2, and >2 positive LNs; whereas 58, 44, and 20 cases had LN metastasis on the right, left, and bilaterally. PATHOLOGIC FEATURES: Eighty-six percent (108 of 125) and 37% (46 of 125) of the cases showed extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion, whereas 64% cases showed lymphovascular invasion. Mean and median total tumor volumes were 6.39 and 3.92 cm, with >/=50% and >/=90% Gleason patterns 4/5 in 105 (84%) and 73 (58%) cases, respectively. CORRELATION WITH DOMINANT TUMOR LOCATION: Dominant lesions on radical prostatectomy were as follows: 50 right lobe, 44 left lobe, and 31 bilateral lobe tumors. Fifteen of 50 (30%) right lobe and 18 of 44 (41%) left lobe dominant tumors had LN metastasis on the contralateral side. Only 4% (5 of 125) of the cases were associated with anterior dominant tumors. CONCLUSION: Thirty percent to 40% of LN metastases occurred contralateral to the dominant tumor. LN metastasis is overwhelmingly associated with high-grade, high-stage, and large volume disease. LN positivity is rarely associated with anterior dominant tumors.",cancer"Primary leiomyosarcoma of the pancreas: study of 9 cases and review of literature. Primary pancreatic leiomyosarcomas are rare lesions and not well described, yet they are the most common primary pancreatic sarcoma. English-language medical literature reports 29 cases as single cases or small series. A systematized nomenclature of medicine (SNOMED) search of Mayo Clinic surgical pathology files from 1994 to 2006 identified 22 primary pancreatic leiomyosarcomas. Nine patients with pancreatic leiomyosarcoma were diagnosed and treated at our institution (5 males and 4 females; mean age at diagnosis, 63 y; range, 39 to 87 y) are described, with a literature review. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-encoded RNA (EBER) was conducted in all cases to exclude EBV-associated smooth muscle tumor (EBV-SMT). Seven of the 9 patients presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice. Seven tumors (mean, 10.7 cm; range, 1.0 to 30 cm) were located in the pancreatic head and 2 in the tail. Histologic findings of primary pancreatic leiomyosarcomas (7 spindle and 2 epithelioid) were similar to leiomyosarcomas of other sites. All tumors stained positive for smooth muscle actin and desmin and negative for KIT. No case showed EBER positivity. Pancreaticoduodenectomy was done in 4 patients; 3 patients had palliative procedures, and 2 had biopsy only. No lymph node metastasis was identified in 4 resected tumors, but liver metastases were present in 4 patients. All patients died; 5 deaths were known to be disease related (overall mean survival, 31 months; range, 5 to 98 mo). Historical cases showed similar clinicopathologic findings. These pancreatic leiomyosarcoma lesions have the same morphologic features as their counterparts of other sites. EBER testing should be conducted--especially for pediatric patients--to rule out EBV-SMT. The tumor is likely to metastasize to liver but not regional lymph nodes. Extensive surgical resection should be advocated, even when morphologic results show a low-grade lesion.",cancer"Oct4 expression in immature teratoma of the ovary: relevance to histologic grade and degree of differentiation. Immature teratoma of the ovary is an uncommon tumor comprising 1% of ovarian malignancies. The amount of immature neuroepithelium in the teratoma is an important prognostic factor. Although the current grading system based on this criterion is widely accepted, the biological significance of immature neuroepithelium is poorly understood. In this study, we used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the expression of Oct4 (also known as Oct3 or POU5F1), a transcription factor expressed in primordial germ cells and embryonic stem cells, along with that of PAX6, a transcription factor contributing to neurogenesis, and CD56, a known marker for tumors of neural origin, in 18 cases of pure immature teratoma of the ovary. Oct4 was expressed in the immature neuroepithelium of all 7 grade-3 cases and 2 grade-2 cases. It was not expressed in 4 grade-2 cases and all 5 grade-1 cases. These tumor cells lacked CD30 or alpha-fetoprotein expression, which supported the diagnosis of pure immature teratoma. PAX6 was expressed in the immature neuroepithelium of all immature teratomas, but not in Oct4-positive cells. CD56 was expressed in neural components of various maturities including PAX6-positive immature neuroepithelium, but not in Oct4-positive cells. These data suggest that the expression of these markers probably reflects the differentiation status of neural tissue in immature teratomas. The finding that Oct4 expression was exclusively detected in immature neuroepithelium of high-grade immature teratomas indicates that Oct4 might serve as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis of highly malignant cases of immature teratoma.",cancer"Cutaneous marginal zone lymphomas have distinctive features and include 2 subsets. Cutaneous marginal zone lymphomas (CMZL) were segregated in the WHO/EORTC consensus classification but grouped with other MALT lymphomas in the subsequent WHO classification. It has been suggested, however, that CMZL have distinctive features and might include 2 subsets. To address these issues, the clinicopathologic, phenotypic and, when possible, genotypic features of 29 CMZL with plasmacytic differentiation were assessed. The monotypic plasma cells had class-switched heavy chain expression in 22 cases, technically inadequate staining in 1 case (included with class-switched cases for analysis) and 6 were IgM. The class-switched cases had a predominance of T cells in 22 out of 23 cases with a CD4:CD8>1 in 15 out of 16 cases, usually showed nodules and scattered small B cells often with IgD apparently nonneoplastic follicles, lacked CXCR3 B-cell expression, never showed a totally diffuse growth pattern, often had prominent mast cells, and lacked known extracutaneous involvement. The IgM cases showed a predominance of B cells in 5 out of 6 (P=0.0003), a diffuse proliferation of CD20 B cells in all (P<0.0001), CXCR3+ B cells in 2 out of 5 (P<0.04), and extracutaneous disease in 3 out of 6 (P<0.008). CD21 usually disrupted follicular dendritic meshworks were seen in 9 out of 12 class-switched and 5 out of 5 IgM cases. CD123 plasmacytoid dendritic cells, PD1+ T follicular helper cells, CD25 or FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, and TIA1/granzyme B cytotoxic cells were never numerous. Only 1 out of 14 tested cases showed a low-level clonal/oligoclonal T cell receptor gamma gene rearrangement. These findings support the presence of 2 types of cutaneous MALT lymphomas with the class-switched cases being the most distinctive but still sharing significant features with MALT lymphomas from other sites, specifically an extranodal extramedullary CD5-, CD10- indolent small B cell lymphoma with plasmacytic differentiation, frequent benign follicular structures, and not fulfilling the criteria for any other well-defined lymphoma.",cancer"A histology-based model for predicting microsatellite instability in colorectal cancers. Identifying colorectal cancers (CRCs) with high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI-H) is clinically important. MSI-H is a positive prognostic marker for CRC, a predictive marker for resistance to standard 5-fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy, and an important feature for identifying individuals and families with Lynch syndrome. Our aim was to compare and improve upon the existing predictive pathology models for MSI-H CRCs. We tested 2 existing models used to predict MSI-H tumors, (1) Revised Bethesda Guidelines and (2) MsPath, in our population-based cohort of CRCs diagnosed less than 75 years from Newfoundland (N=710). We also scored additional histologic features not described in the other models. From this analysis, we developed a model for the prediction of MSI-H CRCs; Pathologic Role in Determination of Instability in Colorectal Tumors (PREDICT). An independent pathologist validated this model in a second cohort of all CRCs (N=276). Tumor histology was a better predictor of MSI status than was personal and family history of cancer. MsPath identified MSI-H CRCs with a sensitivity of 92.1% and a specificity of 37.8%, whereas the Revised Bethesda Guidelines had a sensitivity of 81.3% and a specificity of 39.5%. PREDICT included some new histology features, including peritumoral lymphocytic reaction and increased proportion of plasma cells in the tumor stroma. PREDICT was superior to both existing models in the development cohort with a sensitivity of 97.4% and a specificity of 53.9%. In the validation cohort, sensitivity was 96.9% and specificity 76.6%. We conclude that PREDICT is a good predictor of MSI-H CRC.",cancer"Optimal immunohistochemical markers for distinguishing lung adenocarcinomas from squamous cell carcinomas in small tumor samples. The histologic subtype of non-small cell lung carcinoma is important in selecting appropriate chemotherapy for patients with advanced disease. As many of these patients are not operative candidates, they are treated medically after biopsy for diagnosis. Inherent limitations of small biopsy samples can make distinguishing poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) difficult. The value of histochemical and immunohistochemical markers to help separate poorly differentiated ADC from SCC in resection specimens is well established; however, the optimal use of markers in small tissue samples has only recently been examined and the correlation of marker expression in small tissue samples with histologic subtype determined on resection specimens has not been well documented. We address this issue by examining the expression of 9 markers (p63, TTF1, CK5/6, CK7, 34betaE12, Napsin A, mucicarmine, NTRK1, and NTRK2) on 200 cases of ADC and 225 cases of SCC in tissue microarray format to mimic small tissue specimens. The single best marker to separate ADC from SCC is p63 (for SCC: sensitivity 84%, specificity 85%). Logistic regression analysis identifies p63, TTF1, CK5/6, CK7, Napsin A, and mucicarmine as the optimal panel to separate ADC from SCC. Reduction of the panel to p63, TTF1, CK5/6, and CK7 is marginally less effective but may be the best compromise when tissue is limited. We present an algorithm for the stepwise application of p63, TTF1, CK5/6, CK7, Napsin A, and mucicarmine in situations in which separation of ADC from SCC in small specimens cannot be accomplished by morphology alone.",cancer"Neoadjuvant therapy induces loss of MSH6 expression in colorectal carcinoma. Immunohistochemical stains are routinely used to detect abnormal DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein expression in colorectal carcinomas, particularly when Lynch syndrome is suspected. Complete loss of MMR protein expression is often associated with underlying microsatellite instability (MSI), and the combined results of mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), postmeiotic segregation increased 2 (PMS2), mutS homolog 2 (MSH2), or mutS homolog 6 (MSH6) immunostains may point to the defective MMR protein in tumors with MSI. We have noted that some neoadjuvantly treated colorectal carcinomas display loss of MMR protein immunoexpression, despite a lack of underlying MSI and preserved staining in pretreatment tumor samples. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of this finding. We identified 51 neoadjuvantly treated resected colorectal cancers. Posttreatment tumor samples were immunohistochemically stained with MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 antibodies. Loss of staining for any marker was followed by analysis for MSI and assessment of MMR protein expression in pretreatment tumor samples. All of the 51 posttreatment tumor samples showed preserved MLH1, PMS2, and MSH2, but 10 posttreatment tumor samples (20%) showed decreased MSH6 staining. Of these, 9 posttreatment tumor samples displayed loss of staining in less than 100% of tumor cells, but preserved MSH6 expression in pretreatment tumor samples. One case showed a complete absence of MSH6 staining in both pretreatment and posttreatment tumor samples. All 10 cases were microsatellite stable. We conclude that extensive loss of MSH6 immunoexpression is common among neoadjuvantly treated colorectal carcinomas, but generally does not reflect underlying MSI. Therefore, diminished MSH6 staining in treated tumors should prompt immunohistochemical evaluation of pretreatment biopsy samples before genetic testing for Lynch syndrome.",cancer"Gastric cardiac polyps: a clinicopathologic study of 330 cases. As endoscopists have become more skilled in sampling the gastroesophageal junction, pathologists are being increasingly challenged to characterize previously unknown or neglected findings. One such example is the cardiac polyp. Originally described in the radiology literature as the sentinel fold, the first histologic descriptions of polyps at the gastroesophageal junction did not appear until less than a decade ago. Current clinicopathologic information is limited and somewhat conflicting. This study was designed to define the clinical, endoscopic, and histopathologic associations in patients with cardiac polyps. Using an electronic database, we extracted information on all patients who had a distal esophageal or esophagogastric junctional biopsy during a 24-month period. We then reviewed the slides of 330 adult patients diagnosed with a cardiac polyp and used semiquantitative or qualitative scales to score foveolar hyperplasia, inflammation, erosion or ulcers, epithelial type, and metaplasia. As controls we used 120,487 patients who had biopsies from the same anatomic sites during the same period, but were not diagnosed with a cardiac polyp. There were no significant differences among any clinical indications for esophagogastroduodenoscopy between study and control patients. Endoscopically, a polyp or nodule at the gastroesophageal junction was noted in 59.1% of the patients who had a histopathologic diagnosis of cardiac polyp. Histologically, Barrett mucosa, active esophagitis, and Helicobactor pylori gastritis were all significantly less common in patients with a cardiac polyp than in controls. Although relatively infrequent, synchronous hyperplastic polyps elsewhere in the stomach were significantly more common in patients than in controls. In conclusion, this large series suggests that cardiac polyps are rare but histologically distinct lesions. They are benign and are not uniquely associated with esophagitis, Barrett esophagus, gastroesophageal reflux disease, reactive gastropathy, or gastritis, with or without H. pylori.",cancer"Spectrum of pilomyxoid astrocytomas: intermediate pilomyxoid tumors. To define the spectrum of pilomyxoid morphology and to characterize the association between pilomyxoid astrocytoma (PMA) and pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), 84 cases of pediatric astrocytomas with pilomyxoid features were reviewed. Forty-two of these tumors had coexistent features of PMA and PA (""intermediate""). With the accumulation of more cytoplasm, fibrillar background, microcysts, and thickened blood vessels, these intermediate tumors were more PA-like and less like classic PMA. In the recurrent specimens, PMAs and intermediate tumors sometimes showed more prominent PA features. Both PMA and intermediate tumors involved sites outside the hypothalamus, optic chiasm, and the third ventricle. Both the existence of intermediate tumors and the finding that some PMAs and intermediate tumors mature into PA-like neoplasms over time, provided strong support for a biological relationship between PMA and PA. Additional evidence for a ""maturational effect"" was the finding that intermediate tumors occurred in patients with a median age of 36 months compared with the median age of 21 months for those with PMAs (P=0.017). Features that were often assumed to be poor prognostic indicators in gliomas, that is, necrosis, mitotic figures, and vascular proliferation, were not uncommon in typical PMAs and intermediate lesions. Further follow-up is needed to more accurately determine the prognosis of intermediate tumors.",cancer"EBV-associated cutaneous NK/T-cell lymphoma: review of a series of 14 cases from peru in children and young adults. We have reviewed clinically, morphologically, and immunophenotypically a series of 14 Epstein-Bar virus (EBV)+ cutaneous natural killer cell (NK)/T-cell lymphoma from Peru. Most (11 out of 14) of these cases fit well into the category of Hydroa vacciniforme-like lymphoma (HVLL), but 3 have a different clinical presentation, without facial involvement. In all 14 cases, skin lesions present in both the sun-exposed and nonexposed areas exhibited a slowly progressive relapsing course, changing from edema, to blistering, ulceration, and final scarring. The immunophenotype had a cytotoxic T or NK-cell lineage. The mean time of disease before admission to hospital was 69 months (range, 6 mo to 31 y). Only 2 patients had fever, hepatosplenomegaly, systemic lymphadenopathy, and a high lactate dehydrodenage (LDH) level at the time of diagnosis, whereas 10 had facial swelling. After treatment, only 4 patients remain alive, although with persistent disease. Ten patients died after a mean follow-up of 11.6 months after the initial diagnosis (range, 1 to 32 mo), because of concurrent infections (4 cases), disease progression (4 patients) or both (2 patients). Endemic Epstein-Bar virus (EBV)-positive cutaneous NK/T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders in childhood and early adulthood are characterized by a protracted clinical course, eventually leading to an aggressive phase characterized by concurrent infections and disease progression.",cancer"Fetal lung interstitial tumor (FLIT): A proposed newly recognized lung tumor of infancy to be differentiated from cystic pleuropulmonary blastoma and other developmental pulmonary lesions. The differential diagnosis of congenital lung lesions includes a variety of pulmonary malformations, and uncommon or rare neoplasms such as the pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) and congenital peribronchial myofibroblastic tumor (CPMT). Although most of the congenital lesions have a predominantly cystic appearance, the exceptions of a more solid process are the type 3 congenital cystic adenomatoid or pulmonary airway malformation (CCAM-CPAM) and the CPMT. The clinical and pathologic features of a unique solid or mixed solid/cystic lung mass composed of immature interstitial mesenchyme in association with irregular airspace-like structures mimicking abnormal incompletely developed lung are presented in this report of 10 infants (7 males, 3 females) whose tumor-like lesions were detected in the prenatal period to 3 months of age (median, 1-day old). A lobectomy was done in all 10 infants and 1 infant received adjuvant chemotherapy. One of the surgical resections occurred as an ex utero, antenatal procedure because of fetal ascites. There have been no reported recurrences in those patients with greater than 12 months of follow-up ranging from 15 to 182 months (9 cases). Because of the morphologic resemblance of this mass-like lesion to fetal lung at 20 to 24 weeks gestation (as though any further pulmonary development was arrested in these localized lesions), we are proposing the designation of fetal lung interstitial tumor (FLIT) whose pathogenetic relationship, if any, to type 1 (cystic) pleuropulmonary blastoma remains uncertain to date.",cancer"Lymphomatoid granulomatosis: insights gained over 4 decades. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare lymphoproliferative disease involving predominantly the lung, and there is uncertainty about its relationship to lymphoma. It affects mainly middle-aged adults, although there is a wide age range, and men are affected almost twice as often as women. Multiple nodular, usually bilateral, infiltrates are seen radiographically, and extrapulmonary involvement, especially of skin and nervous system, occurs in more than one third of the patients. Mortality rates are high, and treatment modes are not well established. Morphologically, there is a nodular polymorphous mononuclear cell infiltrate with prominent vascular infiltration and often necrosis. Varying numbers of large, often atypical, CD20-positive B-lymphocytes are present within a background containing numerous CD3-positive small T lymphocytes and scattered admixed plasma cells and histiocytes. Evidence of Epstein-Barr virus infection can be shown in most cases by in-situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus RNA. The infiltrate is graded as 1 to 3 based on the proportion of large B cells. Morphologically, there is overlap in grades 2 and 3 with variants of large B-cell lymphoma, and many such cases show evidence of monoclonality by polymerase chain reaction. It is suggested that lymphoma (T-cell rich large B-cell or diffuse large B-cell) be diagnosed in addition to lymphomatoid granulomatosis in grades 2 and 3 to appropriately communicate the nature of the disease to clinicians.",cancer"Reduced mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation. BACKGROUND: Over the past decade, advances have been made in the care of patients undergoing transplantation. We conducted a study to determine whether these advances have improved the outcomes of transplantation. METHODS: We analyzed overall mortality, mortality not preceded by relapse, recurrent malignant conditions, and the frequency and severity of major complications of transplantation, including graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and hepatic, renal, pulmonary, and infectious complications, among 1418 patients who received their first allogeneic transplants at our center in Seattle in the period from 1993 through 1997 and among 1148 patients who received their first allogeneic transplants in the period from 2003 through 2007. Components of the Pretransplant Assessment of Mortality (PAM) score were used in regression models to adjust for the severity of illness at the time of transplantation. RESULTS: In the 2003-2007 period, as compared with the 1993-1997 period, we observed significant decreases in mortality not preceded by relapse, both at day 200 (by 60%) and overall (by 52%), the rate of relapse or progression of a malignant condition (by 21%), and overall mortality (by 41%), after adjustment for components of the PAM score. The results were similar when the analyses were limited to patients who received myeloablative conditioning therapy. We also found significant decreases in the risk of severe GVHD; disease caused by viral, bacterial, and fungal infections; and damage to the liver, kidneys, and lungs. CONCLUSIONS: We found a substantial reduction in the hazard of death related to allogeneic hematopoietic-cell transplantation, as well as increased long-term survival, over the past decade. Improved outcomes appear to be related to reductions in organ damage, infection, and severe acute GVHD.

PURPOSE: To compare lesion volume determination by applying diameter measurement and three different segmentation algorithms at different slice thicknesses reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) of a phantom model for hepatic colorectal metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Based on CT attenuation measurements obtained retrospectively from 20 patients with colorectal liver metastases, a phantom model was designed with a sponge soaked with a dilution of contrast agent and 6 embedded polyamide spheres (diameter, 8 - 30 mm) to simulate the contrast behavior of liver metastases. CT scans were obtained and reconstructed at different slice thicknesses (0.625/1.25/2.5/3.75 mm; increment, 1). One observer performed software-aided volume determination using the maximum diameter, manual segmentation, seed point method, and threshold method six times for each lesion in a randomized order. Statistical analysis revealed the absolute and relative differences from the actual lesion volumes and the intraobserver differences as well as the influence of slice thickness for each method. RESULTS: The mean relative differences of the seed point method (1.2 - 5.9%) and manual segmentation (2.6 - 4.9%) were significantly lower than the threshold method (5.4 - 12.8%) and diameter measurement (12.3 - 18.5%; p < 0.01). Volume determination by manual segmentation and the seed point method benefited from the use of thin-slice CT datasets. The intraobserver variation was lowest when using the manual segmentation (1.5 - 3.3%) and the seed point method (2.2 - 3.9%; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Manual segmentation and the seed point method for thin CT slices were the methods with the lowest volume differences and intraobserver variation.",cancer"Asymmetric cell division: recent developments and their implications for tumour biology. The ability of cells to divide asymmetrically is essential for generating diverse cell types during development. The past 10 years have seen tremendous progress in our understanding of this important biological process. We have learned that localized phosphorylation events are responsible for the asymmetric segregation of cell fate determinants in mitosis and that centrosomes and microtubules play important parts in this process. The relevance of asymmetric cell division for stem cell biology has added a new dimension to the field, and exciting connections between asymmetric cell division and tumorigenesis have begun to emerge.",cancer"MET signalling: principles and functions in development, organ regeneration and cancer. The MET tyrosine kinase receptor (also known as the HGF receptor) promotes tissue remodelling, which underlies developmental morphogenesis, wound repair, organ homeostasis and cancer metastasis, by integrating growth, survival and migration cues in response to environmental stimuli or cell-autonomous perturbations. The versatility of MET-mediated biological responses is sustained by qualitative and quantitative signal modulation. Qualitative mechanisms include the engagement of dedicated signal transducers and the subcellular compartmentalization of MET signalling pathways, whereas quantitative regulation involves MET partnering with adaptor amplifiers or being degraded through the shedding of its extracellular domain or through intracellular ubiquitylation. Controlled activation of MET signalling can be exploited in regenerative medicine, whereas MET inhibition might slow down tumour progression.",cancer"Microgeographic variations in Burkitt's lymphoma incidence correlate with differences in malnutrition, malaria and Epstein-Barr virus. BACKGROUND: Endemic Burkitt's lymphoma (eBL) has been associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and holoendemic Plasmodium falciparum malaria. But recent evidence suggests that other risk factors are involved. METHODS: We hypothesised that selenoprotein glutathione peroxidase (GPx), a surrogate of nutritional status, is an important biomarker for eBL risk. We measured plasma GPx, anthropometric markers of malnutrition, EBV viral loads and malaria parasitaemia in children aged 1-9 years (n=258) from two locations in Nyanza Province, Kenya, with higher-than-expected and lower-than-expected incidence of eBL. The study participants were malaria asymptomatic children from the community. RESULTS: Children from eBL high-incidence areas had significantly lower GPx levels, high EBV viral load and more evidence of chronic malnutrition than children from eBL low-incidence areas (all P<0.001). Additionally, GPx levels were significantly lower in children with the highest EBV viral load and for those with P. falciparum infections (P=0.035 and P=0.004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that selenium deficiency may be a risk factor for eBL.",cancer"Angiotensin-2 receptors (AT1-R and AT2-R), new prognostic factors for renal clear-cell carcinoma? BACKGROUND: The growth factor Angiotensin-2 signals through Angiotensin receptor type 1 (AT1-R) in a broad range of cell types and tumours and through the type-2 receptor (AT2-R) in a more restricted group of cell types. Although numerous forms of cancer have been shown to overexpress AT1-R, expression of AT1-R and AT2-R by human renal clear-cell carcinoma (RCCC) is not well understood. In this study, the expression of both angiotensin receptors was quantified in a retrospective series of RCCC and correlated with prognostic factors. METHODS: Angiotensin receptor type 1 and AT2-R expressions were quantified on tumour tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blot and quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). IHC results were correlated to Fuhrman's grade and patient progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: A total of 84 RCCC were analysed. By IHC, AT1-R and AT2-R were expressed to a greater level in high-grade tumours (AT1-R: P<0.001, AT2-R: P<0.001). Univariate analysis showed a correlation between PFS and AT1-R or AT2-R expression (P=0.001). By multivariate analysis, only AT2-R expression correlated with PFS (HR 1.021, P=0.006) and cancer stage (P<0.001). By western blot, AT1-R and AT1-R were also found to be overexpressed in higher Fuhrman's grade (P<0.01 and P=0.001 respectively). By qRT-PCR, AT1-R but not AT2-R mRNA were downregulated (P=0.001 and P=0.118, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our results show that AT1-R and AT2-R proteins are overexpressed in the most aggressive forms of RCCC and that AT2-R expression correlates with PFS. AT1-R or AT2-R blockage could, therefore, offer novel directions for anti-RCCC therapy.",cancer"Surveillance of screening-detected cancers (colon and rectum, breast, and cervix) - United States, 2004-2006. PROBLEM/CONDITION: Population-based screening is conducted to detect diseases or other conditions in persons before symptoms appear; effective screening leads to early detection and treatment, thereby reducing disease-associated morbidity and mortality. Based on systematic reviews of the evidence of the benefits and harms and assessments of the net benefit of screening, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends population-based screening for colon and rectum cancer, female breast cancer, and uterine cervix cancer. Few publications have used national data to examine the stage at diagnosis of these screening-amenable cancers. REPORTING PERIOD COVERED: 2004-2006. DESCRIPTION OF SYSTEMS: Data were obtained from cancer registries affiliated with CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Combined data from the NPCR and SEER programs provide the best source of information on national population-based cancer incidence. Data on cancer screening were obtained from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. This report provides stage-specific cancer incidence rates and screening prevalence by demographic characteristics and U.S. state. RESULTS: Approximately half of colorectal and cervical cancer cases and one third of breast cancer cases were diagnosed at a late stage of disease. Incidence rates of late-stage cancer differed by age, race/ethnicity, and state. Incidence rates of late-stage colorectal cancer increased with age and were highest among black men and women. Incidence rates of late-stage breast cancer were highest among women aged 60-79 years and black women. Incidence rates of late-stage cervical cancer were highest among women aged 50-79 years and Hispanic women. The percentage of persons who received recommended screening differed by age, race/ethnicity, and state. INTERPRETATION: Differences in late-stage cancer incidence rates might be explained partially by differences in screening use. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: The findings in this report emphasize the need for ongoing population-based surveillance and reporting to monitor late-stage cancer incidence trends. Screening can identify colorectal, cervical, and breast cancers in earlier and more treatable stages of disease. Multiple factors, including individual characteristics and health behaviors as well as provider and clinical systems factors, might account for why certain populations are underscreened. Cancer control planners, including comprehensive cancer-control programs, can use late-stage cancer incidence and screening prevalence data to identify populations that would benefit from interventions to increase screening utilization and to monitor performance of early detection programs.",cancer"Racial disparities in smoking-attributable mortality and years of potential life lost --- Missouri, 2003-2007. An estimated 443,000 deaths in the United States occur each year as a result of cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. These deaths cost the nation approximately $97 billion in lost productivity and $96 billion in health-care costs. During 2000-2004 in Missouri, smoking caused 9,600 deaths, 132,000 years of potential life lost (YPLL), $2.4 billion in productivity losses, and $2.2 billion in smoking-related health-care expenditures annually. To limit the adverse health consequences of tobacco use, states implement comprehensive tobacco control programs that identify disparities among population groups and target those disproportionately affected by tobacco use. This report compares the public health burden of smoking among whites and blacks in Missouri by estimating the number of smoking-attributable deaths and YPLL in these population subgroups during 2003-2007. The findings indicate that the average annual smoking-attributable mortality (SAM) rate in the state was 18% higher for blacks (338 deaths per 100,000) than for whites (286 deaths per 100,000). The relative difference in smoking-attributable mortality rates between blacks and whites was larger for men (28%) than women (11%). For Missouri, these estimates provide an important benchmark for measuring the success of tobacco control programs in decreasing the burden of smoking-related diseases in these populations and reaffirm the need for full implementation of the state's comprehensive tobacco control program.",cancer"Predicting hematologic toxicity in patients undergoing radioimmunotherapy with 90Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan or 131I-tositumomab. This study aimed at identifying clinical factors for predicting hematologic toxicity after radioimmunotherapy with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan or (131)I-tositumomab in clinical practice. METHODS: Hematologic data were available from 14 non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients treated with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and 18 who received (131)I-tositumomab. The percentage baseline at nadir and 4 wk post nadir and the time to nadir were selected as the toxicity indicators for both platelets and neutrophils. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to identify significant predictors (P < 0.05) of each indicator. RESULTS: For both platelets and neutrophils, pooled and separate analyses of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and (131)I-tositumomab data yielded the time elapsed since the last chemotherapy as the only significant predictor of the percentage baseline at nadir. The extent of bone marrow involvement was not a significant factor in this study, possibly because of the short time elapsed since the last chemotherapy of the 7 patients with bone marrow involvement. Because both treatments were designed to deliver a comparable bone marrow dose, this factor also was not significant. None of the 14 factors considered was predictive of the time to nadir. The R(2) value for the model predicting percentage baseline at nadir was 0.60 for platelets and 0.40 for neutrophils. This model predicted the platelet and neutrophil toxicity grade to within +/-1 for 28 and 30 of the 32 patients, respectively. For the 7 patients predicted with grade I thrombocytopenia, 6 of whom had actual grade I-II, dosing might be increased to improve treatment efficacy. CONCLUSION: The elapsed time since the last chemotherapy can be used to predict hematologic toxicity and customize the current dosing method in radioimmunotherapy.",cancer"Evaluation of metabolic characteristics and viability of lipiodolized hepatocellular carcinomas using 18F-FDG PET/CT. This study aimed to evaluate the metabolic characteristics of lipiodolized hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and the diagnostic accuracy of (18)F-FDG PET/CT in assessing the viability of lipiodolized HCCs. METHODS: Thirty-six patients (age range, 32-73 y) with 38 lipiodolized HCCs who had undergone transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) with lipiodol before (18)F-FDG PET/CT (2-434 d) and 55 patients (age range, 36-77 y) with 57 treatment-naive HCCs who had not been treated with TACE were retrospectively studied. All patients underwent hepatic lobectomy or transplantation within 1 mo after PET/CT and multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT. (18)F-FDG uptake by lipiodolized and naive HCCs was compared and correlated with tumor size, pathologic grade, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration, and time interval between TACE and PET/CT. The diagnostic accuracy of PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT in evaluating the viability of lipiodolized HCC was compared. RESULTS: Histologic examination showed 30 viable and 8 nonviable lipiodolized HCCs. Of the 30 viable tumors, 19 showed increased, 10 similar, and 1 decreased (18)F-FDG uptake. Of the 8 nonviable HCCs, 3 showed increased and 5 decreased (18)F-FDG uptake. Uptake by viable lipiodolized HCCs was correlated with tumor size (P < 0.05) but not correlated with pathologic grade, AFP concentration, or interval between TACE and PET/CT. In contrast, (18)F-FDG uptake by naive HCCs was significantly correlated with tumor size and pathologic grade (P < 0.05 for each comparison). When lipiodolized HCCs with (18)F-FDG uptake that was greater than or similar to that in the surrounding normal liver were considered viable, the diagnostic sensitivity of PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT in the early postembolic period (<3 mo) was 100% and 94%, respectively, and that in the late postembolic period was 93% and 79%, respectively. The specificity of (18)F-FDG PET/CT and contrast-enhanced CT was 63% and 100%, respectively, in the acute period. Three viable lipiodolized HCCs with high AFP concentration were true-positives on PET/CT but false-negatives on contrast-enhanced CT images. CONCLUSION: After TACE, (18)F-FDG uptake in lipiodolized HCCs was not correlated with pathologic grade, in contrast to uptake in treatment-naive HCCs. (18)F-FDG PET/CT showed a high diagnostic sensitivity in assessing the viability of lipiodolized HCCs, with moderate specificity. This method may be useful in determining the viability of lipiodolized HCCs in patients with increased serum AFP concentration or normal results on contrast-enhanced CT images.",cancer"Mediastinoscopy vs endosonography for mediastinal nodal staging of lung cancer: a randomized trial. CONTEXT: Mediastinal nodal staging is recommended for patients with resectable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Surgical staging has limitations, which results in the performance of unnecessary thoracotomies. Current guidelines acknowledge minimally invasive endosonography followed by surgical staging (if no nodal metastases are found by endosonography) as an alternative to immediate surgical staging. OBJECTIVE: To compare the 2 recommended lung cancer staging strategies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Randomized controlled multicenter trial (Ghent, Leiden, Leuven, Papworth) conducted between February 2007 and April 2009 in 241 patients with resectable (suspected) NSCLC in whom mediastinal staging was indicated based on computed or positron emission tomography. INTERVENTION: Either surgical staging or endosonography (combined transesophageal and endobronchial ultrasound [EUS-FNA and EBUS-TBNA]) followed by surgical staging in case no nodal metastases were found at endosonography. Thoracotomy with lymph node dissection was performed when there was no evidence of mediastinal tumor spread. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was sensitivity for mediastinal nodal (N2/N3) metastases. The reference standard was surgical pathological staging. Secondary outcomes were rates of unnecessary thoracotomy and complications. RESULTS: Two hundred forty-one patients were randomized, 118 to surgical staging and 123 to endosonography, of whom 65 also underwent surgical staging. Nodal metastases were found in 41 patients (35%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27%-44%) by surgical staging vs 56 patients (46%; 95% CI, 37%-54%) by endosonography (P = .11) and in 62 patients (50%; 95% CI, 42%-59%) by endosonography followed by surgical staging (P = .02). This corresponded to sensitivities of 79% (41/52; 95% CI, 66%-88%) vs 85% (56/66; 95% CI, 74%-92%) (P = .47) and 94% (62/66; 95% CI, 85%-98%) (P = .02). Thoracotomy was unnecessary in 21 patients (18%; 95% CI, 12%-26%) in the mediastinoscopy group vs 9 (7%; 95% CI, 4%-13%) in the endosonography group (P = .02). The complication rate was similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with (suspected) NSCLC, a staging strategy combining endosonography and surgical staging compared with surgical staging alone resulted in greater sensitivity for mediastinal nodal metastases and fewer unnecessary thoracotomies.

BACKGROUND: Cofactors might affect the risk of the rare progression from infection with carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) to cervical premalignancy to invasive cancer. Some studies have observed that Chlamydia trachomatis infection is associated with increased risk for cervical cancer. In a large prospective cohort, we assessed the role of C trachomatis in cervical premalignancy and addressed confounding by HPV. METHODS: We identified 182 women with prevalent and 132 women with incident histological cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 (CIN2), grade 3 (CIN3), or cervical cancer (CIN2+) in the Costa Rica HPV Natural History Study. Control subjects were 995 (approximately 10% of the 10 049) subjects who were randomly selected from the same study. Cervical HPV status at enrollment was determined by MY09/MY11 polymerase chain reaction amplification and dot-blot hybridization. The presence of C trachomatis DNA in cervical exfoliated cells at enrollment was determined by a novel serovar-specific polymerase chain reaction-based C trachomatis detection and genotyping assay. Plasma drawn at enrollment from each subject was used to determine C trachomatis immunoglobulin G (IgG) status. Logistic regression was used to examine the association between C trachomatis and CIN2+, taking into account possible confounding by HPV. RESULTS: C trachomatis positivity at enrollment was associated with CIN2+ and concurrent and subsequent carcinogenic HPV infection. To account for confounding by HPV status, we restricted the analysis to women positive for carcinogenic HPV DNA at enrollment and found no association between C trachomatis status (as assessed by DNA or IgG) at enrollment and combined prevalent and/or incident CIN2+ (for C trachomatis DNA positivity, odds ratio = 0.77, 95% confidence interval = 0.42 to 1.41; for C trachomatis seropositivity, odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval = 0.85 to 1.41). CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between C trachomatis status, as assessed by DNA or IgG, and risk of cervical premalignancy, after controlling for carcinogenic HPV-positive status. Previous positive associations between C trachomatis and cervical premalignancy could have been caused, in part, by an increased susceptibility to HPV infection.",cancer"The Mediterranean and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets and colorectal cancer. BACKGROUND: Although the Mediterranean diet has been studied for cancer mortality and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet shares similarities with the Mediterranean diet, few studies have specifically examined these 2 diets and incident colorectal cancer. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to prospectively assess the association between the Alternate Mediterranean Diet (aMed) and the DASH-style diet scores and risk of colorectal cancer in middle-aged men and women. DESIGN: A total of 87,256 women and 45,490 men (age 30-55 y for women and 40-75 y for men at baseline) without a history of cancer were followed for </= 26 y. The aMed and DASH scores were calculated for each participant by using dietary information that was assessed </= 7 times during follow-up. Relative risks (RRs) for colorectal cancer were computed with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: We documented 1432 cases of incident colorectal cancer among women and 1032 cases in men. Comparing top with bottom quintiles of the DASH score, the pooled RR for total colorectal cancer was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.91; P for trend = 0.0001). The corresponding RR for DASH score and colon cancer was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.69, 0.95; P for trend = 0.002). There was a suggestion of an inverse association with rectal cancer with a pooled RR of 0.73 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.98; P for trend = 0.31) when comparing top with bottom quintiles of DASH score. No association was observed with aMed score. CONCLUSION: Adherence to the DASH diet (which involves higher intakes of whole grains, fruit, and vegetables; moderate amounts of low-fat dairy; and lower amounts of red or processed meats, desserts, and sweetened beverages) was associated with a lower risk of colorectal cancer.",cancer"Major urologic problems in geriatrics: assessment and management. Elderly urologic patients require the same cautions as used in development of treatment programs for them in other disciplines. Because of potential interference with poor renal function or crossover effects with central or peripheral nervous system, however, many urologic drugs must be titrated appropriately. In treating cancer, erectile dysfunction, incontinence or urinary infection, patient quality of life and life span become dominant factors in making therapeutic decisions, by behavioral change, medication, or surgical intervention.",cancer"Use and assessment of PSA in prostate cancer. Since the introduction of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the late 1980s, more prostate cancers have been detected, and at an earlier stage. As a consequence, the majority of prostate cancers are now detected years before the emergence of clinically evident disease, which usually represents locally advanced or metastatic cancer. PSA screening has remained controversial, because many of the prostate cancers detected are low grade and slow growing. With this long natural history and a median survival without treatment that often approaches at least 15 to 20 years, many clinicians and researchers have questioned if prostate cancer screening and treatment actually improves survival, as many patients will die with prostate cancer rather than of prostate cancer. In this review, the authors discuss the rationale for prostate cancer screening and present the current guidelines for the use of PSA.",cancer"Evaluation and management of the renal mass. The evaluation and management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has evolved in recent decades in response to the changing clinical presentation of the disease. Traditional teaching suggested that RCC usually presents with signs or symptoms. However, RCC discovered this way was usually locally advanced and often metastatic, requiring radical nephrectomy in most cases but often having a poor prognosis. As contemporary general medical practice began routinely using axial body imaging in the evaluation of many nonspecific abdominal complaints, today more than 70% of RCC cases identified are ""screen-detected"" as incidental findings having no attributable symptoms. This change has prompted a significant RCC stage migration over the past 20 years, with most kidney tumors seen in 2010 being smaller, organ-confined, and appropriate for nephron-sparing approaches with the anticipation of a favorable outcome. The approach to addressing patients with these incidentally detected, often localized, small renal masses raises different concerns than those for traditional patients presenting with symptomatic RCC. This article reviews the modern epidemiology of RCC, outlines the components of the evaluation of the incidental renal mass, details the current options of management, and discusses the long-term expectations for these patients.",cancer"Cavernous hemangioma of the orbital apex: pathogenetic considerations in surgical management. PURPOSE: To consider the pathogenesis and growth of cavernous hemangioma, particularly within the crowded orbital apex, in decisions regarding surgical indications, timing, and technique. DESIGN: A perspective based on analysis of the microanatomic relationships and growth potential of apical cavernous hemangiomas, with representative case studies illustrating management recommendations. METHODS: Analysis of microscopic findings in typical and vision-loss cases; review of tumor growth patterns as reported in observational and interventional studies; consideration of surgical approaches and reported functional outcomes. RESULTS: An ongoing, local hemodynamic imbalance may drive the proliferation of a cavernous hemangioma. Extension into neighboring tissue induces a fibrous capsule, which is continually reconstituted as the lesion expands, and which may incorporate visually critical structures in the confines of the apex. The extent of this microanatomic intimacy is not detectable preoperatively. The tumor's remaining growth potential at the time of diagnosis or following incomplete resection is not predictable. CONCLUSIONS: Patients without significant vision deficits should be observed for progression. Those with significant deficits or signs of progression should be offered timely surgery, with recognition of the risks. The surgical approach should be individualized based on macroanatomic relationships. The decision to intervene should not be a commitment to complete resection at any cost; intraoperative recognition of ""inoperable"" attachments may dictate modifications in order to preserve vision.",cancer"Differentiation of vascular tumors from vascular malformations by expression of Wilms tumor 1 gene: evaluation of 126 cases. BACKGROUND: Vascular tumors and malformations can be challenging to diagnose. Although they may initially appear very similar, they have distinct clinical courses and management. Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) gene expression has been reported in many different tumors including hematologic malignancies and some solid tumors. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the expression of WT1 in 126 vascular lesions (64 vascular tumors, one Masson tumor, and 61 vascular malformations). METHODS: Based on the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies classification of vascular anomalies, we studied the expression of WT1 in vascular tumors composed of infantile hemangioma, congenital hemangiomas (non-involuting, rapidly involuting, and not otherwise specified), pyogenic granuloma, tufted angioma, cherry angioma, Kaposi sarcoma, and angiosarcoma. We also studied WT1 expression in vascular malformations composed of angiokeratoma/verrucous hemangioma, combined vascular malformations, venous malformations, glomuvenous malformations, lymphatic malformations/lymphangioma, telangiectasia, and targetoid hemosiderotic hemangioma. RESULTS: All vascular tumors and proliferations had positive WT1 cytoplasmic endothelial immunostaining whereas only 3 vascular malformations were WT1 positive. Moreover the positivity of WT1 in these vascular malformations was focal and involved only re-endothelialized neovessels within thrombi. LIMITATIONS: The low number of malignant vascular tumors is a limitation. CONCLUSIONS: Immunohistochemical detection of WT1 could be a useful tool to routine evaluation of vascular anomalies allowing the distinction of vascular tumors and proliferations from vascular malformations. Staining for WT1 may guide the clinician in difficult cases, as positive results would suggest a proliferative vascular lesion whereas negative results might point to a vascular malformation.",cancer"Impact of prolonged fraction delivery times simulating IMRT on cultured nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell killing. PURPOSE: To determine the impact of prolonged fraction delivery times (FDTs) simulating intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) on cultured nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell killing. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Cultured NPC cell lines CNE1 and CNE2 were used in this study. The biological effectiveness of fractionated irradiation protocols simulating conventional external beam radiotherapy and IMRT (FDT of 15, 36, and 50 minutes) was estimated with standard colony assay, and the differences in cell surviving fractions after irradiation with different protocols were tested by use of the paired t test. The impact degree of prolonged FDTs (from 8 to 50 minutes) on cell killing was also assessed by the dose-modifying factors, which were estimated by comparing the effectiveness of intermittently delivered 2 Gy with that of continuously delivered 1.5 to 2 Gy. RESULTS: The cell surviving fractions of both CNE1 and CNE2 after fractionated irradiation simulating IMRT were higher than those simulating conventional external beam radiotherapy (p < 0.05). The dose-modifying factors for a fraction dose of 2 Gy increased from 1.05 to 1.18 for CNE1 and from 1.05 to 1.11 for CNE2 with the FDT being prolonged from 15 to 50 minutes. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the prolonged FDTs simulating IMRT significantly decreased the cell killing in both CNE1 and CNE2 cell lines, and these negative effects increased with the FDT being prolonged from 15 to 50 minutes. These effects, if confirmed by in vivo and clinical studies, need to be considered in designing IMRT treatments for NPC.",cancer"Case series. Soft-tissue sarcoma of the foot. BACKGROUND: We reviewed cases of soft-tissue sarcoma of the foot to gain insight into the presentation, treatments and outcomes for this rare disease and to determine whether limb-salvage surgery yields reasonable functional and oncological outcomes. METHODS: We reviewed the cases of 16 patients treated by 2 of us (R.T. and M.I.) for soft-tissue sarcoma of the foot over a 15-year period. We extracted the following information from each patient's medical record: disease status at presentation, prior treatment, histological diagnosis, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, details of treatment, oncological outcome and functional outcome. Functional outcome was assessed with the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score (TESS) and the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS 1987). RESULTS: Follow-up averaged 6 (range 2-15) years. Eight patients presented after unplanned excision. Histological diagnosis was synovial sarcoma for 7 of 16 patients.The tumours were evenly distributed among the hindfoot, midfoot and forefoot. Most patients (n = 13) presented with AJCC stage II or III disease. Amputation was necessary for 3 patients, whereas limb salvage was possible for the other 13. Free tissue transfer (n = 9) and radiation therapy (n = 12) were used in most cases. Surgical margins were microscopically positive in 4 of the 13 patients treated with limb salvage.Local disease recurred in 2 patients. Lung metastases occurred in 4 patients. At last follow-up, 11 of 16 patients were alive without disease, 2 with disease and 3 had died of their disease. Functional assessment with MSTS 1987 and the TESS averaged 28%and 90%, respectively, after limb salvage. CONCLUSION: In this series, we found that, first, patients frequently presented after unplanned excision, and this may have led to worse oncological outcomes compared with patients who presented primarily. Second, limb salvage was usually possible, but it required accepting marginal resections, relying on free tissue transfer to obtain coverage and using radiation therapy to obtain local control. Third, this combination yielded an acceptable local control rate and very good functional outcomes.",cancer"Management of primary rectal cancer by surgeons in Atlantic Canada: results of a regional survey. BACKGROUND: We sought to determine the current practice patterns of general surgeons in Atlantic Canada in the management of primary rectal cancer in relation to surgeon-specific variables. METHODS: We sent mail-out surveys to all practising general surgeons (n = 183) in Atlantic Canada to determine screening preferences, preoperative assessment, the use of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, surgical therapy for rectal cancer and surgeon demographics. We analyzed the responses using chi(2) tests. RESULTS: The response rate was 98 (54%) after 2 mail-outs; there were 82 (49%) eligible responses. Surgeons in practice for 21 years or more were more likely than those with fewer than 21 years of practice to order preoperative ultrasonography of the liver and were less likely to order preoperative computed tomography. Endorectal ultrasonography was ordered routinely by 23% of surgeons, whereas 71% of surgeons would order it if time and resources were available. Surgeons who were not certified by the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada were significantly more likely than those who were certified to use neoadjuvant therapy in all patients with rectal cancer (43% v. 12%; p = 0.031). Surgeons who performed more than 10 rectal cancer surgeries per year were significantly more likely than those who performed 10 or fewer surgeries per year to use neoadjuvant treatment for T3 tumours (94% v. 61%; p = 0.007). Surgeons with medical or radiation oncology services in their communities were significantly more likely than those without such services to recommend neoadjuvant treatment in T3 rectal tumours and rectal tumours with pathologic lymph nodes. CONCLUSION: We found significant variation in the management of rectal cancer depending on surgeon-specific variables. The implications of these differences on the outcomes of patients with rectal cancer are unknown.",cancer"Effectiveness of voice rehabilitation on vocalisation in postlaryngectomy patients: a systematic review. BACKGROUND: Laryngeal cancer is one of the most common malignant neoplasia of the head and neck. Its incidence has been increasing steadily all over the world. Many patients will undergo total laryngectomy with or without radical neck dissection after being diagnosed. After this surgery, normal speech is lost, and a permanent stoma in the middle of the neck is left. Therefore, voice rehabilitation is one of the most difficult challenges that these patients must overcome. In order to support the patients, otolaryngologists, nursing specialists and speech pathologists have explored several different methods for voice rehabilitation. Variations exist on the approaches of rehabilitation and indicators selected to measure the effectiveness. There is a need to undertake a systematic review to provide a plan of care and ascertain the effectiveness regarding different voice rehabilitation programs for postlaryngectomy patients. REVIEW OBJECTIVE: To critically analyse the literature and present the best available evidence related to the effectiveness of voice rehabilitation program on postlaryngectomy patients. SEARCH STRATEGY: A three-step search strategy was utilised. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and CINAHL databases was undertaken followed by an analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract to identify the optimal index terms. A second extensive search using all identified key words and index terms was then undertaken. Third, the reference list and bibliographies of all identified reports and articles were searched for additional studies. The measurement index included voice intelligibility, volume, clarity, quality of voice, patients' satisfaction, quality of life, etc. The search included reports in English and Chinese. SELECTION CRITERIA: The review considered any randomised controlled trials that addressed voice rehabilitation methods in postlaryngectomy patients. In the absence of randomised controlled trials, other quantitative research designs, such as non-randomised controlled trials, cohort studies and case-controlled studies, were considered for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Full copies of articles considered to meet the inclusion criteria were obtained for critical appraisal by two reviewers using the CASP (Critical Appraisal Skills Program) and McMaster scales. We utilised the 60% fulfilling of the evaluation scale items as the cut-off point and articles with a quality score less than 60% were excluded. Details of eligible trials were extracted and summarised by two reviewers independently using standardised data extraction tools developed by the Joanna Briggs Institute. RESULTS: Twenty-two articles were included in the review (Appendix I). Different voice rehabilitation methods for laryngectomees were investigated in the included studies including oesophageal voice, electrolarynx voice and surgical voice restoration. One cohort studies, five prospective studies, five retrospective studies and 11 descriptive studies were included. Because of the heterogeneity of included studies, meta-analysis was not possible. Therefore, the results were presented in narrative summary. The following main findings were identified: 1 At present, oesophageal speech, electrolarynx and tracheoesophageal were the commonly used voice rehabilitation methods with total laryngectomy patients. 2 Among these three methods, the success rate of electrolarynx and tracheoesophageal is much higher than oesophageal speech. 3 The intelligibility and speech quality of electrolarynx was lower than tracheoesophageal. 4 Patient satisfaction and self-assessed quality of life was better in tracheoesophageal group. 5 The objective index was similar between excellent tracheoesophageal and oesophageal speech patients. Conclusion 1 Electrolarynx is the easiest vocal rehabilitation method for total laryngectomy patients to use as it requires little training and does not limit the patients. But patients' satisfaction was lower because of the mechanical voice and noise. 2 Oesophageal speech is the hardest vocal rehabilitation method to learn. It needs a long period of time to practise and requires the patient to be in good physical condition and to be relatively young. The success rate was relatively lower; however, it is the most commonly used rehabilitation method in developing countries because of low cost. 3 Tracheoesophageal is the most commonly used voice rehabilitation method in developed countries. It is a surgical method that could be performed as either a primary procedure or secondary procedure. Reported patient quality of life and satisfaction following tracheoesophageal were the best; however, there are complications and the frequent replacement of the prostheses is an important problem yet to be solved. Implication for practice 1 Voice rehabilitation after total laryngectomy is an immediate and long-term problem that patients and health worker must face. 2 Healthcare workers should understand the advantages and disadvantages of each voice rehabilitation method in detail to assist people with total laryngectomy to make the most appropriate decision in regard to rehabilitation method taking into consideration their age, sex, physical condition, job, economic status and other context factors. Implication for research 1 Further high-quality studies comparing the effectiveness of oesophageal speech, electrolarynx and tracheoesophageal vocal rehabilitation methods are needed, especially with the subjective and objective outcome index concurrently. 2 Further investigation is required to identify strategies to decrease the complications of tracheoesophageal and reduce frequency of required tracheoesophageal replacement. 3 More research is needed in the context of developing countries where healthcare resources may be limited.",cancer"Pheochromocytoma during pregnancy treated by surgery. A case report and the review of the literature. INTRODUCTION: Prenatal diagnosis of pheocromocytoma, although rare, is important as it allows a reduction in both maternal mortality and foetal loss. Pheocromocytoma operated on in the first trimester of pregnancy with survival of both patient and foetus is rare in literature. Our case was operated on with success after a correct and early diagnosis was obtained despite a chronic hypertension which existed long before pregnancy. Our case study well illustrates that a correct multidisciplinary approach involving endocrinologists, anesthesiologists, surgeons and gynecologists is fundamental for a positive outcome. CASE REPORT: The case of a white caucasian pregnant woman at 13th weeks of gestation with pheocromocytoma and severe and unstable hypertension that could not be pharmacologically controlled is described. Morphological diagnosis was safely obtained by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) without intravenous medium contrast agent. Pre-operative treatment consisted of therapy with alpha-blockers and rehydration. Adrenalectomy was performed through a laparotomy. Postoperative treatment consisted of rehydration and ephedrine continued until the fourth post-operative day. The post-operative period was uneventful and a new ultrasound (US) scan confirmed foetal vitality. The patient was discharged seven days after surgery. A live newborn was physiologically delivered after a nine-month pregnancy. CONCLUSION: A correct diagnosis in all pregnant women with severe hypertension particularly those not screened for secondary hypertension and a multidisciplinary management are mandatory to obtain optimal results and avoid deleterious effects at delivery.",cancer"Single port laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy with the TriPort system. A case report and review of the literature. AIM: We report our recent experience with the TriPort system (trademark of Advanced Surgical Concepts, Wicklow, Ireland) to perform a laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy via a single periumbilical incision. CASE REPORT: A 48-year-old multiparous woman was referred to us on March 2009 because of menometrorrhagia and uterine fibroids. RESULTS: The procedure was performed without intraoperative complications. The weight of the uterus was 360 gr. At the 10 months follow-up the patient did not refer any problem. DISCUSSION: Although our experience represented a potentially difficult surgery because of the size of the uterus, severe adhesions (two previous caesarean sessions) and the lack of experience with the new system, the procedure demonstrated to be feasible. As for our knowledge the present report represents the first case of single port laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy performed with the TriPort system in Italy. CONCLUSION: Single port laparoscopy is feasible and could potentially decrease postoperative pain as well as increase patient satisfaction. Although the early experience with TriPort system is promising, experienced laparoscopic skills are essential for the safe and effective performing of the procedure.",cancer"Pancreatic pseudocyst-inferior vena cava fistula causing caval stenosis, left renal vein thrombosis, subcutaneous fat necrosis, arthritis and dysfibrinogenemia. AIM: We describe the case of a 38 year old man, with a story of alcohol abuse, who developed a very painful nodular subcutaneous fat necrosis, fever and polyarthritis, denying any abdominal symptoms due to a pancreatic pseudocyst-inferior vena cava fistula. MATERIAL OF STUDY: The authors discuss the unusual and protracted course with intermittent hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia related to clinical manifestations such as subcutaneous fat necrosis, polyarthritis, pleural effusion and dysfibrinogenemia, and vascular complications as inferior vena cava stenosis and left renal vein thrombosis without abdominal symptomatology. RESULTS: After ultrasonograms and CT Scans showing a 3-4 cm cyst at the pancreatic head with a solid bud protruding into the pseudocystic cavity, and an ERCP showing a communication between the pancreatic duct and the pseudocyst but failing in demonstrating the vascular fistula, the patient underwent a Roux-en-y pseudocyst-jejunostomy and suture of the caval communication leading to complete recovery with normalization of laboratory findings. DISCUSSION: In our case, the locally sclerosing activity of the enzymes in the endothelium led to a communication between the inferior vena cava and the pseudocyst and to a complete thrombosis of the left renal vein and to a stenosis of the inferior vena cava itself The fluctuance of the symptomatology severity was probably due to an intermittent opening of the passage between pseudocyst and vena cava. Such a clinical case, to the author knowledge, has never been reported. CONCLUSION: When in presence of very high levels of amylasemia and lipasemia in spite of the paucity of abdominal symptomatology, and the onset of unusual complications such as panniculitis, pleural effusion, arthritis and coagulative disorders, a pancreatic pseudocyst-inferior vena cava fistula should be kept in consideration during diagnosis.",cancer"Novel multitargeted anticancer oral therapies: sunitinib and sorafenib as a paradigm. The introduction of novel targeted therapies into the clinic in recent years has had a considerable impact on the management of several neoplastic diseases--such as gastrointestinal stromal tumors, hepatocellular carcinomas and renal cell carcinomas--considered until recently refractory to systemic therapies. We describe here two such novel biological agents, sunitinib and sorafenib, as a paradigm of the successful clinical application of new concepts. Sunitinib and sorafenib are small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that target vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor, C-Kit and others. Both agents are administered orally; sunitinib is tyically given in cycles for 4 consecutive weeks with 2 weeks off, while sorafenib is given continually. Side effects occur in most patients, similar for both agents; they may affect several systems and organs but are mostly mild and easily manageable, rarely requiring discontinuation of the drug. However, these toxicities mandate prompt attention and intervention. The most frequently observed effects are hypertension, nausea, anorexia, asthenia and cutaneous manifestations; cardiac abnormalities may include congestive failure. Sunitinib, and markedly less frequently sorafenib, may cause thyroid gland dysfunction, mainly hypothyroidism. Antitumor activity has been shown for renal cell carcinoma in pivotal trials, for sunitinib as first-line treatment and for sorafenib in previously treated patients as second-line. Sunitinib is now approved as second-line therapy for patients with GIST refractory to imatinib; sorafenib has resulted in a significant prolongation in median survival in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Ongoing clinical trials will further define the spectrum of these agents' antitumor activity, their role in combination with other drugs, as well as their optimal dose and schedule of administration.",cancer"Investigation of the eIF2alpha phosphorylation mechanism in response to proteasome inhibition in melanoma and breast cancer cells. The 26S proteasome is an ATP-dependent proteolytic complex found in all eukaryotes, archaebacteria, and some eubacteria. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome causes pleiotropic effects in cells, including cellular apoptosis, a fact that has led to the use of the 26S proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, for treatment of the multiple myeloma cancer. We previously showed that in addition to the effects of proteolysis, inhibition of the 26S proteasome causes a rapid decrease in the protein synthesis rate due to phosphorylating alfa subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) by the heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI). In order to test whether inhibition of the 26S proteasome causes the same effect in cancer cells, we have investigated the influence of two commonly used proteasome inhibitors, bortezomib and MG132, on the phosphorylation status of eIF2alpha in B16F10 melanoma and 4T1 breast cancer cells. It was found that both of the inhibitors caused rapid phosphorylation of eIF2alpha. Taking into account that the Hsp70 is a critical component needed for the HRI activation and enzymatic activity, we have tested a possible participation of this protein in the eIF2alpha phosphorylation event. However, treatment of the cells with two structurally different Hsp70 inhibitors, quercetin and KNK437, in the presence of the proteasome inhibitors did not affect the eIF2alpha phosphorylation. In addition, neither protein kinase C (PKC) nor p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was required for the proteasome inhibitor-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation; futhermore, both the PKC inhibitor staurosporine and the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 caused enchanced phosphorylation of eLF2alpha. Zinc (II) protoporphyrine IX (ZnPP), an inhibitor of the heme-oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which has also been previously reported to be involved in HRI activation, also failed to prevent the induction of eIF2alpha phosphorylation in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib or MG132.",cancer"A holistic approach to a rare pathology. A case of cystic hygroma (CH), a congenital lymph-filled multicystic hamartoma of the neck, with a holistic approach to patient management is presented. The stigma of the CH imposed by attending physicians, dentists, parents, teachers and peers affected the psychological development of this patient since her diagnosis in childhood. Although surgery relieves the threat of airway obstruction and may improve the esthetic appearance of the CH, the patient may be isolated and traumatized by the ignorance and superstitions of the individuals she encounters on a daily basis.",cancer"A new fast and fully automated software based algorithm for extracting respiratory signal from raw PET data and its comparison to other methods. PURPOSE: Respiratory gating in PET is an approach used to minimize the negative effects of respiratory motion on spatial resolution. It is based on an initial determination of a patient's respiratory movements during a scan, typically using hardware based systems. In recent years, several fully automated databased algorithms have been presented for extracting a respiratory signal directly from PET data, providing a very practical strategy for implementing gating in the clinic. In this work, a new method is presented for extracting a respiratory signal from raw PET sinogram data and compared to previously presented automated techniques. METHODS: The acquisition of respiratory signal from PET data in the newly proposed method is based on rebinning the sinogram data into smaller data structures and then analyzing the time activity behavior in the elements of these structures. From this analysis, a 1D respiratory trace is produced, analogous to a hardware derived respiratory trace. To assess the accuracy of this fully automated method, respiratory signal was extracted from a collection of 22 clinical FDG-PET scans using this method, and compared to signal derived from several other software based methods as well as a signal derived from a hardware system. RESULTS: The method presented required approximately 9 min of processing time for each 10 min scan (using a single 2.67 GHz processor), which in theory can be accomplished while the scan is being acquired and therefore allowing a real-time respiratory signal acquisition. Using the mean correlation between the software based and hardware based respiratory traces, the optimal parameters were determined for the presented algorithm. The mean/median/range of correlations for the set of scans when using the optimal parameters was found to be 0.58/0.68/0.07-0.86. The speed of this method was within the range of real-time while the accuracy surpassed the most accurate of the previously presented algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: PET data inherently contains information about patient motion; information that is not currently being utilized. We have shown that a respiratory signal can be extracted from raw PET data in potentially real-time and in a fully automated manner. This signal correlates well with hardware based signal for a large percentage of scans, and avoids the efforts and complications associated with hardware. The proposed method to extract a respiratory signal can be implemented on existing scanners and, if properly integrated, can be applied without changes to routine clinical procedures.",cancer"Measuring output factors of small fields formed by collimator jaws and multileaf collimator using plastic scintillation detectors. PURPOSE: As the practice of using high-energy photon beams to create therapeutic radiation fields of subcentimeter dimensions (as in intensity-modulated radiotherapy or stereotactic radiosurgery) grows, so too does the need for accurate verification of beam output at these small fields in which standard practices of dose verification break down. This study investigates small-field output factors measured using a small plastic scintillation detector (PSD), as well as a 0.01 cm3 ionization chamber. Specifically, output factors were measured with both detectors using small fields that were defined by either the X-Y collimator jaws or the multileaf collimator (MLC). METHODS: A PSD of 0.5 mm diameter and 2 mm length was irradiated with 6 and 18 MV linac beams. The PSD was positioned vertically at a source-to-axis distance of 100 cm, at 10 cm depth in a water phantom, and irradiated with fields ranging in size from 0.5 x 0.5 to 10 x 10 cm2. The field sizes were defined either by the collimator jaws alone or by a MLC alone. The MLC fields were constructed in two ways: with the closed leaves (i.e., those leaves that were not opened to define the square field) meeting at either the field center line or at a 4 cm offset from the center line. Scintillation light was recorded using a CCD camera and an estimation of error in the median-filtered signals was made using the bootstrapping technique. Measurements were made using a CC01 ionization chamber under conditions identical to those used for the PSD. RESULTS: Output factors measured by the PSD showed close agreement with those measured using the ionization chamber for field sizes of 2.0 x 2.0 cm2 and above. At smaller field sizes, the PSD obtained output factors as much as 15% higher than those found using the ionization chamber by 0.6 x 0.6 cm2 jaw-defined fields. Output factors measured with no offset of the closed MLC leaves were as much as 20% higher than those measured using a 4 cm leaf offset. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' results suggest that PSDs provide a useful and possibly superior alternative to existing dosimetry systems for small fields, as they are inherently less susceptible to volume-averaging and perturbation effects than larger, air-filled ionization chambers. Therefore, PSDs may provide more accurate small-field output factor determination, regardless of the collimation mechanism.",cancer"Surface applicator calibration and commissioning of an electronic brachytherapy system for nonmelanoma skin cancer treatment. PURPOSE: The Xoft Axxent x-ray source has been used for treating nonmelanoma skin cancer since the surface applicators became clinically available in 2009. The authors report comprehensive calibration procedures for the electronic brachytherapy (eBx) system with the surface applicators. METHODS: The Xoft miniature tube (model S700) generates 50 kVp low-energy x rays. The new surface applicators are available in four sizes of 10, 20, 35, and 50 mm in diameter. The authors' tests include measurements of dose rate, air-gap factor, output stability, depth dose verification, beam flatness and symmetry, and treatment planning with patient specific cutout factors. The TG-61 in-air method was used as a guideline for acquiring nominal dose-rate output at the skin surface. A soft x-ray parallel-plate chamber (PTW T34013) and electrometer was used for the output commissioning. GafChromic EBT films were used for testing the properties of the treatment fields with the skin applicators. Solid water slabs were used to verify the depth dose and cutout factors. Patients with basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma were treated with eBx using a calibrated Xoft system with the low-energy x-ray source and the skin applicators. RESULTS: The average nominal dose-rate output at the skin surface for the 35 mm applicator is 1.35 Gy/min with +/- 5% variation for 16 sources. The dose-rate output and stability (within +/- 5% variation) were also measured for the remaining three applicators. For the same source, the output variation is within 2%. The effective source-surface distance was calculated based on the air-gap measurements for four applicator sizes. The field flatness and symmetry are well within 5%. Percentage depth dose in water was provided by factory measurements and can be verified using solid water slabs. Treatment duration was calculated based on the nominal dose rate, the prescription fraction size, the depth dose percentage, and the cutout factor. The output factor needs to be measured for each case with varying shapes of cutouts. CONCLUSIONS: Together with TG-61, the authors' methodology provides comprehensive calibration procedures for medical physicists for using the Xoft eBx system and skin applicators for nonmelanoma skin cancer treatments.",cancer"Monte Carlo evaluation of scatter mitigation strategies in cone-beam CT. PURPOSE: To investigate the efficacy of two widely used scatter mitigation methods: antiscatter grids (ASGs) and beam modulating with bowtie filters (BTFs), in combination with subtractive scatter correction or zeroth order normalization phantom calibration, for improving image noise, contrast, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and image uniformity for on-board cone-beam CT (CBCT) imaging systems used for image-guided radiation therapy. METHODS: PTRAN Monte Carlo CBCT x-ray projections of head and pelvic phantoms were calculated for combinations of beam-modulation and scatter rejection methods and images were reconstructed by in-house developed software. In addition, a simple one-dimensional analytic model was developed to predict scatter-to-primary ratio (SPR) and CNR as a function of cylindrical phantom thickness, ASG transmission, and beam modulation with bow-tie filters. RESULTS: ASGs were found to have slightly negative or no effect on head phantom image CNR and to modestly improve CNR (10%-20%) in pelvic phantom images. However, scatter subtraction and norm-phantom calibration perform better when applied on data acquired with ASGs. Scatter subtraction improves CT number accuracy, but increases noise, and in high SPR/low primary-photon transmission scenarios can dramatically reduce CNR and introduce streaking artifacts. The BTF is found to reduce SPR and image noise, resulting in a better trade-off between CNR and imaging dose, but introduces a circular band artifact. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that ASGs have a modest positive impact in pelvic scans and negative in head scans, scatter subtraction improves the HU accuracy but reduces CNR, while BTF has a clearly positive effect.",cancer"Model-based calculations of off-axis ratio of conic beams for a dedicated 6 MV radiosurgery unit. PURPOSE: Because the small-radius photon beams shaped by cones in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) lack lateral electronic equilibrium and a detector's finite cross section, direct experimental measurement of dosimetric data for these beams can be subject to large uncertainties. As the dose calculation accuracy of a treatment planning system largely depends on how well the dosimetric data are measured during the machine's commissioning, there is a critical need for an independent method to validate measured results. Therefore, the authors studied the model-based calculation as an approach to validate measured off-axis ratios (OARs). METHODS: The authors previously used a two-component analytical model to calculate central axis dose and associated dosimetric data (e.g., scatter factors and tissue-maximum ratio) in a water phantom and found excellent agreement between the calculated and the measured central axis doses for small 6 MV SRS conic beams. The model was based on that of Nizin and Mooij [""An approximation of central-axis absorbed dose in narrow photon beams,"" Med. Phys. 24, 1775-1780 (1997)] but was extended to account for apparent attenuation, spectral differences between broad and narrow beams, and the need for stricter scatter dose calculations for clinical beams. In this study, the authors applied Clarkson integration to this model to calculate OARs for conic beams. OARs were calculated for selected cones with radii from 0.2 to 1.0 cm. To allow comparisons, the authors also directly measured OARs using stereotactic diode (SFD), microchamber, and film dosimetry techniques. The calculated results were machine-specific and independent of direct measurement data for these beams. RESULTS: For these conic beams, the calculated OARs were in excellent agreement with the data measured using an SFD. The discrepancies in radii and in 80%-20% penumbra were within 0.01 cm, respectively. Using SFD-measured OARs as the reference data, the authors found that the calculated OARs were more accurate than those measured with a microchamber or film dosimetry. CONCLUSIONS: The model produces sufficiently accurate conic beam dosimetric data that can be used to validate direct measurement results for such beams.",cancer"Characterization of a real-time surface image-guided stereotactic positioning system. PURPOSE: The AlignRT3C system is an image-guided stereotactic positioning system (IGSPS) that provides real-time target localization. This study involves the first use of this system with three camera pods. The authors have evaluated its localization accuracy and tracking ability using a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) system and an optical tracking system in a clinical setting. METHODS: A modified Rando head-and-neck phantom and five patients receiving intracranial stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) were used to evaluate the calibration, registration, and position-tracking accuracies of the AlignRT3C system and to study surface reconstruction uncertainties, including the effects due to interfractional and intrafractional motion, skin tone, room light level, camera temperature, and image registration region of interest selection. System accuracy was validated through comparison with the Elekta kV CBCT system (XVI) and the Varian frameless SonArray (FSA) optical tracking system. Surface-image data sets were acquired with the AlignRT3C daily for the evaluation of pretreatment and interfractional and intrafractional motion for each patient. Results for two different reference image sets, planning CT surface contours (CTS) and previously recorded AlignRT3C optical surface images (ARTS), are reported. RESULTS: The system origin displacements for the AlignRT3C and XVI systems agreed to within 1.3 mm and 0.7 degrees. Similar results were seen for AlignRT3C vs FSA. For the phantom displacements having couch angles of 0 degrees, those that utilized ART_S references resulted in a mean difference of 0.9 mm/0.4 degrees with respect to XVI and 0.3 mm/0.2 degrees with respect to FSA. For phantom displacements of more than +/- 10 mm and +/- 3 degrees, the maximum discrepancies between AlignRT and the XVI and FSA systems were 3.0 and 0.4 mm, respectively. For couch angles up to +/- 90 degrees, the mean (max.) difference between the AlignRT3C and FSA was 1.2 (2.3) mm/0.7 degrees (1.2 degrees). For all tests, the mean registration errors obtained using the CT_S references were approximately 1.3 mm/1.0 degrees larger than those obtained using the ART_S references. For the patient study, the mean differences in the pretreatment displacements were 0.3 mm/0.2 degrees between the AlignRT3C and XVI systems and 1.3 mm/1 degrees between the FSA and XVI systems. For noncoplanar treatments, interfractional motion displacements obtained using the ART_S and CT_S references resulted in 90th percentile differences within 2.1 mm/0.8 degrees and 3.3 mm/0.3 degrees, respectively, compared to the FSA system. Intrafractional displacements that were tracked for a maximum of 14 min were within 1 mm/1 degrees of those obtained with the FSA system. Uncertainties introduced by the bite-tray were as high as 3 mm/2 degrees for one patient. The combination of gantry, aSi detector panel, and x-ray tube blockage effects during the CBCT acquisition resulted in a registration error of approximately 3 mm. No skin-tone or surface deformation effects were seen with the limited patient sample. CONCLUSIONS: AlignRT3C can be used as a nonionizing IGSPS with accuracy comparable to current image/marker-based systems. IGSPS and CBCT can be combined for high-precision positioning without the need for patient-attached localization devices.",cancer"Direct measurement of instantaneous source speed for a HDR brachytherapy unit using an optical fiber based detector. PURPOSE: Several attempts to determine the transit time of a high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy unit have been reported in the literature with controversial results. The determination of the source speed is necessary to accurately calculate the transient dose in brachytherapy treatments. In these studies, only the average speed of the source was measured as a parameter for transit dose calculation, which does not account for the realistic movement of the source, and is therefore inaccurate for numerical simulations. The purpose of this work is to report the implementation and technical design of an optical fiber based detector to directly measure the instantaneous speed profile of a 192Ir source in a Nucletron HDR brachytherapy unit. METHODS: To accomplish this task, we have developed a setup that uses the Cerenkov light induced in optical fibers as a detection signal for the radiation source moving inside the HDR catheter. As the 192Ir source travels between two optical fibers with known distance, the threshold of the induced signals are used to extract the transit time and thus the velocity. The high resolution of the detector enables the measurement of the transit time at short separation distance of the fibers, providing the instantaneous speed. RESULTS: Accurate and high resolution speed profiles of the 192Ir radiation source traveling from the safe to the end of the catheter and between dwell positions are presented. The maximum and minimum velocities of the source were found to be 52.0 +/- 1.0 and 17.3 +/- 1.2 cm/s. The authors demonstrate that the radiation source follows a uniformly accelerated linear motion with acceleration of [a] = 113 cm/s2. In addition, the authors compare the average speed measured using the optical fiber detector to those obtained in the literature, showing deviation up to 265%. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of the authors' knowledge, the authors directly measured for the first time the instantaneous speed profile of a radiation source in a HDR brachytherapy unit traveling from the unit safe to the end of the catheter and between interdwell distances. The method is feasible and accurate to implement on quality assurance tests and provides a unique database for efficient computational simulations of the transient dose.",cancer"Shading correction for on-board cone-beam CT in radiation therapy using planning MDCT images. PURPOSE: Applications of cone-beam CT (CBCT) to image-guided radiationtherapy (IGRT) are hampered by shading artifacts in the reconstructed images. These artifacts are mainly due to scatter contamination in the projections but also can result from uncorrected beam hardening effects as well as nonlinearities in responses of the amorphous silicon flat panel detectors. While currently, CBCT is mainly used to provide patient geometry information for treatment setup, more demanding applications requiring high-quality CBCT images are under investigation. To tackle these challenges, many CBCT correction algorithms have been proposed; yet, a standard approach still remains unclear. In this work, we propose a shading correction method for CBCT that addresses artifacts from low-frequency projection errors. The method is consistent with the current workflow of radiation therapy. METHODS: With much smaller inherent scatter signals and more accurate detectors, diagnostic multidetector CT (MDCT) provides high quality CT images that are routinely used for radiation treatment planning. Using the MDCT image as ""free"" prior information, we first estimate the primary projections in the CBCT scan via forward projection of the spatially registered MDCT data. Since most of the CBCT shading artifacts stem from low-frequency errors in the projections such as scatter, these errors can be accurately estimated by low-pass filtering the difference between the estimated and raw CBCT projections. The error estimates are then subtracted from the raw CBCT projections. Our method is distinct from other published correction methods that use the MDCT image as a prior because it is projection-based and uses limited patient anatomical information from the MDCT image. The merit of CBCT-based treatment monitoring is therefore retained. RESULTS: The proposed method is evaluated using two phantom studies on tabletop systems. On the Catphan 600 phantom, our approach reduces the reconstruction error from 348 Hounsfield unit (HU) without correction to 4 HU around the object center after correction, and from 375 HU to 17 HU in the high-contrast regions. In the selected regions of interest (ROIs), the average image contrast is increased by a factor of 3.3. When noise suppression is implemented, the proposed correction substantially improves the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and therefore the visibility of low-contrast objects, as seen in a more challenging pelvis phantom study. Besides a significant improvement in image uniformity, a low-contrast object of approximately 25 HU, which is otherwise buried in the shading artifacts, can be clearly identified after the proposed correction due to a CNR increase of 3.1. Compared to a kernel-based scatter correction method coupled with an analytical beam hardening correction, our approach also shows an overall improved performance with some residual artifacts. CONCLUSIONS: By providing effective shading correction, our approach has the potential to improve the accuracy of more advanced CBCT-based clinical applications for IGRT, such as tumor delineation and dose calculation.",cancer"Regularized antenna profile adaptation in online hyperthermia treatment. PURPOSE: Online optimization of annular-phased-array hyperthermia (HT) is based on planning tools and magnetic resonance (MR) thermometry. Until now, the method has been validated in phantoms. Further developments and extensions are required for clinical purposes. In particular, the problem of deducing the electric field distribution inside the patient from MR thermometry is ill-posed, which leads to an amplification of measurement errors. A method to overcome this difficulty is proposed. METHODS: The authors utilized a regularized Gauss-Newton algorithm with a fast bioheat transfer equation (BHTE) approximation to identify the field parameters. To evaluate the method, simulations with patient models are conducted and a treatment data set obtained from a heat treatment performed in the hybrid HT-MR system at the Charite Medical School is used to visualize the error amplification. RESULTS: The regularization leads to a significantly improved accuracy of the predicted electric fields and temperatures compared to an unregularized approach. The BHTE approximation enables highly accurate temperature predictions in real-time. CONCLUSIONS: Regularization proves to be necessary to identify electromagnetic field parameters. The proposed method is able to reproduce measurements without overfitting to the noise in the MR measurements and results in an improved treatment planning.",cancer"Apparent absence of a proton beam dose rate effect and possible differences in RBE between Bragg peak and plateau. PURPOSE: Respiration-gated irradiation for a moving target requires a longer time to deliver single fraction in proton radiotherapy (PRT). Ultrahigh dose rate (UDR) proton beam, which is 10-100 times higher than that is used in current clinical practice, has been investigated to deliver daily dose in single breath hold duration. The purpose of this study is to investigate the survival curve and relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of such an ultrahigh dose rate proton beam and their linear energy transfer (LET) dependence. METHODS: HSG cells were irradiated by a spatially and temporally uniform proton beam at two different dose rates: 8 Gy/min (CDR, clinical dose rate) and 325 Gy/min (UDR, ultrahigh dose rate) at the Bragg peak and 1.75 (CDR) and 114 Gy/min (UDR) at the plateau. To study LET dependence, the cells were positioned at the Bragg peak, where the absorbed dose-averaged LET was 3.19 keV/microm, and at the plateau, where it was 0.56 keV/microm. After the cell exposure and colony assay, the measured data were fitted by the linear quadratic (LQ) model and the survival curves and RBE at 10% survival were compared. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in the survival curves between the two proton dose rates. The ratio of the RBE for CDR/UDR was 0.98 +/- 0.04 at the Bragg peak and 0.96 +/- 0.06 at the plateau. On the other hand, Bragg peak/plateau RBE ratio was 1.15 +/- 0.05 for UDR and 1.18 +/- 0.07 for CDR. CONCLUSIONS: Present RBE can be consistently used in treatment planning of PRT using ultrahigh dose rate radiation. Because a significant increase in RBE toward the Bragg peak was observed for both UDR and CDR, further evaluation of RBE enhancement toward the Bragg peak and beyond is required.",cancer"Monte Carlo calculated TG-60 dosimetry parameters for the beta- emitter 153Sm brachytherapy source. PURPOSE: The formalism recommended by Task Group 60 (TG-60) of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) is applicable for beta sources. Radioactive biocompatible and biodegradable 153Sm glass seed without encapsulation is a beta- emitter radionuclide with a short half-life and delivers a high dose rate to the tumor in the millimeter range. This study presents the results of Monte Carlo calculations of the dosimetric parameters for the 153Sm brachytherapy source. METHODS: Version 5 of the (MCNP) Monte Carlo radiation transport code was used to calculate two-dimensional dose distributions around the source. The dosimetric parameters of AAPM TG-60 recommendations including the reference dose rate, the radial dose function, the anisotropy function, and the one-dimensional anisotropy function were obtained. RESULTS: The dose rate value at the reference point was estimated to be 9.21 +/- 0.6 cGy h(-1) microCi(-1). Due to the low energy beta emitted from 153Sm sources, the dose fall-off profile is sharper than the other beta emitter sources. The calculated dosimetric parameters in this study are compared to several beta and photon emitting seeds. CONCLUSIONS: The results show the advantage of the 153Sm source in comparison with the other sources because of the rapid dose fall-off of beta ray and high dose rate at the short distances of the seed. The results would be helpful in the development of the radioactive implants using 153Sm seeds for the brachytherapy treatment.",cancer"A support vector machine (SVM) for predicting preferred treatment position in radiotherapy of patients with breast cancer. PURPOSE: NYU 05-181 protocol compared the CT simulation in both supine and prone positions for 400 patients with breast cancer (200 left-breast and 200 right-breast) to identify which setup is better at sparing heart and lung involvement in the treatment process. The results demonstrated that all right-breast patients benefited from the prone treatment position, while for left-breast patients, 85% were better treated prone and 15% were better treated supine. Using the clinical data collected from this protocol, the authors aimed at developing an automated tool capable of identifying which of the left-breast cancer patients are better treated supine without obtaining a second CT scan in the supine position. METHODS: Prone CT scans from 198 of the 200 left-breast cancer patients enrolled in NYU 05-181 protocol were deidentified and exported to a dedicated research planning workstation. Three-dimensional geometric features of the organs at risk and tumor bed were extracted. A two-stage classifier was used to classify patients into the prone class or the supine class. In the first stage, the authors use simple thresholding to divide the patients into two groups based on their in-field heart volume. For patients with in-field heart volume < or = 0.1 cc, the prone position was chosen as the preferred treatment position. Patients with in-field heart volume > 0.1 cc will be further classified in the second stage by a weighted support vector machine (SVM). The weight parameters of the SVM were adjusted to maximize the specificity [true-supine/(true-supine+false-prone)] at the cost of lowering but still maintaining reasonable sensitivity [true-prone/(true-prone+false-supine)]. The authors used K-fold cross validations to test the performance of the SVM classifier. A feature selection algorithm was also used to identify features that give the best classification performance. RESULTS: After the first stage, 49 of the 198 left-breast cancer patients were found to have > 0.1 cc of in-field heart volume. The three geometric features of heart orientation, distance between heart and tumor, and in-field lung were selected by the feature selection algorithm in the second stage of the two-stage classifier to give the best predefined weighted accuracy. The overall sensitivity and specificity of the proposed method were found to be 90.4% and 99.3%, respectively. Using two-stage classification, the authors reduced the proportion of prone-treated patients that need a second supine CT scan down to 16.3/170 or 9.6%, as compared to 21/170 or 12.4% when the authors use only the first stage (thresholding) for classification. CONCLUSIONS: The authors' study showed that a feature-based classifier is feasible for predicting the preferred treatment position, based on features extracted from prone CT scans. The two-stage classifier achieved very high specificity at an acceptable expense of sensitivity.",cancer"Advanced treatment planning methods for efficient radiation therapy with laser accelerated proton and ion beams. PURPOSE: Laser plasma acceleration can potentially replace large and expensive cyclotrons or synchrotrons for radiotherapy with protons and ions. On the way toward a clinical implementation, various challenges such as the maximum obtainable energy still remain to be solved. In any case, laser accelerated particles exhibit differences compared to particles from conventional accelerators. They typically have a wide energy spread and the beam is extremely pulsed (i.e., quantized) due to the pulsed nature of the employed lasers. The energy spread leads to depth dose curves that do not show a pristine Bragg peak but a wide high dose area, making precise radiotherapy impossible without an additional energy selection system. Problems with the beam quantization include the limited repetition rate and the number of accelerated particles per laser shot. This number might be too low, which requires a high repetition rate, or it might be too high, which requires an additional fluence selection system to reduce the number of particles. Trying to use laser accelerated particles in a conventional way such as spot scanning leads to long treatment times and a high amount of secondary radiation produced when blocking unwanted particles. METHODS: The authors present methods of beam delivery and treatment planning that are specifically adapted to laser accelerated particles. In general, it is not necessary to fully utilize the energy selection system to create monoenergetic beams for the whole treatment plan. Instead, within wide parts of the target volume, beams with broader energy spectra can be used to simultaneously cover multiple axially adjacent spots of a conventional dose delivery grid as applied in intensity modulated particle therapy. If one laser shot produces too many particles, they can be distributed over a wider area with the help of a scattering foil and a multileaf collimator to cover multiple lateral spot positions at the same time. These methods are called axial and lateral clustering and reduce the number of particles that have to be blocked in the beam delivery system. Furthermore, the optimization routine can be adjusted to reduce the number of dose spots and laser shots. The authors implemented these methods into a research treatment planning system for laser accelerated particles. RESULTS: The authors' proposed methods can decrease the amount of secondary radiation produced when blocking particles with wrong energies or when reducing the total number of particles from one laser shot. Additionally, caused by the efficient use of the beam, the treatment time is reduced considerably. Both improvements can be achieved without extensively changing the quality of the treatment plan since conventional intensity modulated particle therapy usually includes a certain amount of unused degrees of freedom which can be used to adapt to laser specific properties. CONCLUSIONS: The advanced beam delivery and treatment planning methods reduce the need to have a perfect laser-based accelerator reproducing the properties of conventional accelerators that might not be possible without increasing treatment time and secondary radiation to the patient. The authors show how some of the differences to conventional beams can be overcome and efficiently used for radiation treatment.",cancer"Clinical development of a failure detection-based online repositioning strategy for prostate IMRT--experiments, simulation, and dosimetry study. PURPOSE: To implement and evaluate clinic-ready adaptive imaging protocols for online patient repositioning (motion tracking) during prostate IMRT using treatment beam imaging supplemented by minimal, as-needed use of on-board kV. METHODS: The authors examine the two-step decision-making strategy: (1) Use cine-MV imaging and online-updated characterization of prostate motion to detect target motion that is potentially beyond a predefined threshold and (2) use paired MV-kV 3D localization to determine overthreshold displacement and, if needed, reposition the patient. Two levels of clinical implementation were evaluated: (1) Field-by-field based motion correction for present-day linacs and (2) instantaneous repositioning for new-generation linacs with capabilities of simultaneous MV-kV imaging and remote automatic couch control during treatment delivery. Experiments were performed on a Varian Trilogy linac in clinical mode using a 4D motion phantom programed with prostate motion trajectories taken from patient data. Dosimetric impact was examined using a 2D ion chamber array. Simulations were done for 536 trajectories from 17 patients. RESULTS: Despite the loss of marker detection efficiency caused by the MLC leaves sometimes obscuring the field at the marker's projected position on the MV imager, the field-by-field correction halved (from 23% to 10%) the mean percentage of time that target displacement exceeded a 3 mm threshold, as compared to no intervention. This was achieved at minimal cost in additional imaging (average of one MV-kV pair per two to three treatment fractions) and with a very small number of repositionings (once every four to five fractions). Also with low kV usage (approximation 2/fraction), the instantaneous repositioning approach reduced overthreshold time by more than 75% (23% to 5%) even with severe MLC blockage as often encountered in current IMRT and could reduce the overthreshold time tenfold (to < 2%) if the MLC blockage problem were relieved. The information acquired for repositioning using combined MV-kV images was found to have submillimeter accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: This work demonstrated with a current clinical setup that substantial reduction of adverse targeting effects of intrafraction prostate motion can be realized. The proposed adaptive imaging strategy incurs minimal imaging dose to the patient as compared to other stereoscopic imaging techniques.",cancer"Modeling scatter-to-primary dose ratio for megavoltage photon beams. PURPOSE: A three-parameter semiempirical model for scatter-to-primary dose ratio (SPR) is proposed to fit PDD (or TPR) and S(p) beam data. The SPR formula proposed in this study is more accurate than the previously published formula utilizing two parameters, especially for lower energy megavoltage photon beams, because the effect of backscattered photons is now taken into account. METHODS: Monte Carlo (MC) calculated SPR for photon energy spectrum between 60Co and 24 MV are used to evaluate the accuracy of the models. Based on fitting the MC data, the dependence of the SPR parameters (a0, w0,d0) with the attenuation coefficients of the photon beams is obtained and they were incorporated into the authors' optimization routine. The ability of the optimization routine to fit measured clinic data is examined for photon energies ranging from 60Co to 25 MV for all major cobalt and linear accelerator manufacturers. RESULTS: The authors' model successfully fits the measured photon beam data for field size (E/3-40 cm), where E is photon energy in MV and for clinically usable depths, d(max) to 20 cm for 60Co, d(max) to 30 cm for 4 MV, and d(max) to 40 cm for 6 MV and higher photon energies. The maximum error among these fits is better than 2% for photon energies above 60Co. CONCLUSIONS: The new SPR formula, along with the optimization routine, can serve as an efficient tool for performing quality control of x-ray beam data that conforms to AAPM Radiation Therapy Committee TG40 and Therapy Physics Committee TG142 reports on beam data requirement.",cancer"Cascaded analysis of signal and noise propagation through a heterogeneous breast model. PURPOSE: The detectability of lesions in radiographic images can be impaired by patterns caused by the surrounding anatomic structures. The presence of such patterns is often referred to as anatomic noise. Others have previously extended signal and noise propagation theory to include variable background structure as an additional noise term and used in simulations for analysis by human and ideal observers. Here, the analytic forms of the signal and noise transfer are derived to obtain an exact expression for any input random distribution and the ""power law"" filter used to generate the texture of the tissue distribution. METHODS: A cascaded analysis of propagation through a heterogeneous model is derived for x-ray projection through simulated heterogeneous backgrounds. This is achieved by considering transmission through the breast as a correlated amplification point process. The analytic forms of the cascaded analysis were compared to monoenergetic Monte Carlo simulations of x-ray propagation through power law structured backgrounds. RESULTS: As expected, it was found that although the quantum noise power component scales linearly with the x-ray signal, the anatomic noise will scale with the square of the x-ray signal. There was a good agreement between results obtained using analytic expressions for the noise power and those from Monte Carlo simulations for different background textures, random input functions, and x-ray fluence. CONCLUSIONS: Analytic equations for the signal and noise properties of heterogeneous backgrounds were derived. These may be used in direct analysis or as a tool to validate simulations in evaluating detectability.",cancer"VMC++ validation for photon beams in the energy range of 20-1000 keV. PURPOSE: In high energy teletherapy, VMC++ is known to be a very accurate and efficient Monte Carlo (MC) code. In principle, the MC method is also a powerful dose calculation tool in other areas in radiation oncology, e.g., brachytherapy or orthovoltage radiotherapy. However, VMC++ is not validated for the low-energy range of such applications. This work aims in the validation of the VMC++ MC code for photon beams in the energy range between 20 and 1000 keV. METHODS: Dose calculations were performed in different 40 x 40 x 40 cm3 phantoms of different materials. Dose distributions of monoenergetic (ranging from 20 to 1000 keV) 10 x 10 and 2 x 2 cm2 parallel beams were calculated. Voxel sizes of 4 x 4 x 4 and 1 x 1 x 1 mm3 were used for the dose calculations. The resulting dose distributions were compared to those calculated using EGSnrc, which is used as a golden standard in this work. RESULTS: At energies between 100 and 1000 keV, EGSnrc and VMC++ calculated dose distributions agree within the statistical uncertainty of about 1% (1sigma). At energies < or = 50 keV, dose differences of up to 1.6% (in % of D(max)) occur when VMC++ and EGSnrc are compared. Turning off Rayleigh scattering, binding effects for Compton scattering, and the atomic relaxation after photoelectric absorption in EGSnrc (all not implemented in VMC++) leads to an agreement between both MC codes within statistical uncertainty. Further, using the KERMA approximation feature implemented in VMC++ leads to very efficient simulations in the energy range between 20 and 1000 keV. CONCLUSIONS: Further improvements for very low energies in accuracy of VMC++ could be achieved by implementing Rayleigh scattering, binding effects for Compton scattering, and the atomic relaxation after photoelectric absorption. Implementation into VMC++ of KERMA approximation has been validated.",cancer"Fundus image fusion in EYEPLAN software: an evaluation of a novel technique for ocular melanoma radiation treatment planning. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate a novel approach for treatment planning using digital fundus image fusion in EYEPLAN for proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) planning for ocular melanoma. The authors used a prototype version of EYEPLAN software, which allows for digital registration of high-resolution fundus photographs. The authors examined the improvement in tumor localization by replanning with the addition of fundus photo superimposition in patients with macular area tumors. METHODS: The new version of EYEPLAN (v3.05) software allows for the registration of fundus photographs as a background image. This is then used in conjunction with clinical examination, tantalum marker clips, surgeon's mapping, and ultrasound to draw the tumor contour accurately. In order to determine if the fundus image superimposition helps in tumor delineation and treatment planning, the authors identified 79 patients with choroidal melanoma in the macular location that were treated with PBRT. All patients were treated to a dose of 56 GyE in four fractions. The authors reviewed and replanned all 79 macular melanoma cases with superimposition of pretreatment and post-treatment fundus imaging in the new EYEPLAN software. For patients with no local failure, the authors analyzed whether fundus photograph fusion accurately depicted and confirmed tumor volumes as outlined in the original treatment plan. For patients with local failure, the authors determined whether the addition of the fundus photograph might have benefited in terms of more accurate tumor volume delineation. RESULTS: The mean follow-up of patients was 33.6 +/- 23 months. Tumor growth was seen in six eyes of the 79 macular lesions. All six patients were marginal failures or tumor miss in the region of dose fall-off, including one patient with both in-field recurrence as well as marginal. Among the six recurrences, three were managed by enucleation and one underwent retreatment with proton therapy. Three patients developed distant metastasis and all three patients have since died. The replanning of six patients with their original fundus photograph superimposed showed that in four cases, the treatment field adequately covered the tumor volume. In the other two patients, the overlaid fundus photographs indicated the area of marginal miss. The replanning with the fundus photograph showed improved tumor coverage in these two macular lesions. For the remaining patients without local failure, replanning with fundus photograph superimposition confirmed the tumor volume as drawn in the original treatment plan. CONCLUSIONS: Local control was excellent in patients receiving 56 GyE of PBRT for uveal melanomas in the macular region, which traditionally can be more difficult to control. Posterior lesions are better defined with the additional use of fundus image since they can be difficult to mark surgically. In one-third of treatment failing patients, the superposition of the fundus photograph would have clearly allowed improved localization of tumor. The current practice standard is to use the superimposition of the fundus photograph in addition to the surgeon's clinical and clip mapping of the tumor and ultrasound measurement to draw the tumor volume.",cancer"Sensitivity of low energy brachytherapy Monte Carlo dose calculations to uncertainties in human tissue composition. PURPOSE: The objective of this work is to assess the sensitivity of Monte Carlo (MC) dose calculations to uncertainties in human tissue composition for a range of low photon energy brachytherapy sources: 125I, 103Pd, 131Cs, and an electronic brachytherapy source (EBS). The low energy photons emitted by these sources make the dosimetry sensitive to variations in tissue atomic number due to the dominance of the photoelectric effect. This work reports dose to a small mass of water in medium D(w,m) as opposed to dose to a small mass of medium in medium D(m,m). METHODS: Mean adipose, mammary gland, and breast tissues (as uniform mixture of the aforementioned tissues) are investigated as well as compositions corresponding to one standard deviation from the mean. Prostate mean compositions from three different literature sources are also investigated. Three sets of MC simulations are performed with the GEANT4 code: (1) Dose calculations for idealized TG-43-like spherical geometries using point sources. Radial dose profiles obtained in different media are compared to assess the influence of compositional uncertainties. (2) Dose calculations for four clinical prostate LDR brachytherapy permanent seed implants using 125I seeds (Model 2301, Best Medical, Springfield, VA). The effect of varying the prostate composition in the planning target volume (PTV) is investigated by comparing PTV D90 values. (3) Dose calculations for four clinical breast LDR brachytherapy permanent seed implants using 103Pd seeds (Model 2335, Best Medical). The effects of varying the adipose/gland ratio in the PTV and of varying the elemental composition of adipose and gland within one standard deviation of the assumed mean composition are investigated by comparing PTV D90 values. For (2) and (3), the influence of using the mass density from CT scans instead of unit mass density is also assessed. RESULTS: Results from simulation (1) show that variations in the mean compositions of tissues affect low energy brachytherapy dosimetry. Dose differences between mean and one standard deviation of the mean composition increasing with distance from the source are observed. It is established that the 125I and 131Cs sources are the least sensitive to variations in elemental compositions while 103Pd is most sensitive. The EBS falls in between and exhibits complex behavior due to significant spectral hardening. Results from simulation (2) show that two prostate compositions are dosimetrically equivalent to water while the third shows D90 differences of up to 4%. Results from simulation (3) show that breast is more sensitive than prostate with dose variations of up to 30% from water for 70% adipose/30% gland breast. The variability of the breast composition adds a +/- 10% dose variation. CONCLUSIONS: Low energy brachytherapy dose distributions in tissue differ from water and are influenced by density, mean tissue composition, and patient-to-patient composition variations. The results support the use of a dose calculation algorithm accounting for heterogeneities such as MC. Since this work shows that variations in mean tissue compositions affect MC dosimetry and result in increased dose uncertainties, the authors conclude that imaging tools providing more accurate estimates of elemental compositions such as dual energy CT would be beneficial.",cancer"Respiratory distress in newborn: evaluation of chest X-rays. We discuss the anatomic and pathophysiological patterns of preterm and term newborn. Particular attention is directed to technical artefacts relating to the interpretation of chest radiography. We analyze the reading of chest X-Ray of preterm with low birth weight and poor lung maturation. Are also taken into account X-Ray features relating to alveolar ""recruitment"" and radiographic changes after surfactant's administration. We highlight the most important paintings of bruncopulmonary dysplasia and its evolution. The most frequent neonatal pulmonary inflammation and thoraco-pulmonary malformation, that may affect more the neonatologist, are mentioned. We discuss the new diagnostic approach with non invasive techniques (ultrasound) in the neonatal distress. Some easily recognizable congenital heart disease are finally describes.",cancer"The efficacy of chemical adjuvants on giant-cell tumour of bone. An in vitro study. Various chemicals are commonly used as adjuvant treatment to surgery for giant-cell tumour (GCT) of bone. The comparative effect of these solutions on the cells of GCT is not known. In this study we evaluated the cytotoxic effect of sterile water, 95% ethanol, 5% phenol, 3% hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and 50% zinc chloride (ZnCI(2)) on GCT monolayer tumour cultures which were established from six patients. The DNA content, the metabolic activity and the viability of the cultured samples of tumour cells were assessed at various times up to 120 hours after their exposure to these solutions. Equal cytotoxicity to the GCT monolayer culture was observed for 95% ethanol, 5% phenol, 3% H(2)O(2) and 50% ZnCI(2). The treated samples showed significant reductions in DNA content and metabolic activity 24 hours after treatment and this was sustained for up to 120 hours. The samples treated with sterile water showed an initial decline in DNA content and viability 24 hours after treatment, but the surviving cells were viable and had proliferated. No multinucleated cell formation was seen in these cultures. These results suggest that the use of chemical adjuvants other than water could help improve local control in the treatment of GCT of bone.",cancer"Does the southern European cardiovascular mortality advantage extend to total mortality? 50-year trends in death risks between 40 and 70 years of age in Western European men and women. AIMS: To study 50-year mortality trends in men and women of northern and southern Western Europe. METHODS: The World Health Organization mortality data base and multiple decrement life table methods was used to compute all-cause and cause-specific risks of middle-age death (40-69 years of age) for northern (Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, and UK) and southern (France, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland) Western European countries. RESULTS: From 1952 to 2001, the risk of a cardiovascular death in middle age was higher in the north compared to the south. The north/ south cardiovascular mortality ratios (MR) peaked in 1990-1993 and were 1.57 among women and 1.47 among men in 2001. In 1952, the all-cause risks of middle-age death were similar in the north and south for both women and men (39% and 27%, respectively). In 2001, middle-age death risks were similar for men in the north and the south (24% and 23%, MR = 1.05), but higher among women in the north compared to the south (14% and 11%, MR = 1.28). Cause-specific death risks demonstrated that the cardiovascular advantage for southern European men was countered by a disadvantage in cancer death risk (2001 north/south cancer MR = 0.85). For northern European women in 2001, there was a disadvantage also in the other major cause-of-death groups: cancer (MR = 1.22) and other diseases (MR = 1.28). CONCLUSIONS: The southern European cardiovascular middle-age mortality advantage extended to total mortality much more for women than for men. We suggest that forces behind this gender difference in this north/south mortality gradient include life style factors.",cancer"Reassessing the standard of care in indolent lymphoma: a clinical update to improve clinical practice. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) represents a diverse group of hematologic malignancies originating in B or T lymphocytes. Approximately 85% of NHLs are of B-cell origin, with the remainder mostly of T-cell origin. The most common NHL types are diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (31%) and follicular lymphoma (22%). More than 65,000 new cases of NHL develop each year, and approximately 20,000 people with NHL died of the disease 2009. NHL is the seventh most common cancer in the United States, contributes to approximately 4% to 5% of all cancer cases in the United States, and causes approximately 3% of all cancer-related deaths. Currently, nearly 500,000 people are living with the disease or are in remission. Several new and encouraging advances have been made in the treatment of indolent NHL. Although the watch and wait approach still has a role, combined immunochemotherapy remains the standard of care for both first-line and relapsed/refractory disease. As front-line treatment, bendamustine plus rituximab may become a new standard of care, especially for older patients. In contrast, rituximab in combination with chemotherapy followed by rituximab maintenance seems to be the optimal option in patients with relapsed disease.",cancer"Preliminary report: the development of the NCCN Comparative Therapeutic Index as a clinical evaluative process for existing data in oncology. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) develops and communicates the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines) to oncologists and other clinicians. The NCCN Guidelines are widely recognized and applied as the standard for clinical policy in the United States. These guidelines and related documents, such as the NCCN Drugs & Biologics Compendium (NCCN Compendium), are used extensively by public and private payors as the basis for the setting of coverage policies. Given the demand for comparative effectiveness (CE) analyses, as described and discussed in this report, the NCCN has begun work on a paradigm to integrate evidence-based CE analysis into the NCCN Guidelines deliberative process. This report presents NCCN's initial thinking on the use of NCCN expert panel members in developing a process that can be used to compare health care technologies (e.g., radiation modalities, chemotherapy regimens) in a formal, systematic way. Draft considerations are provided to stimulate discussion and feedback, particularly in the oncology community, as NCCN moves through processes such as methodologic review, validation of rating scales, and review of implications for public policy, toward finalization of an NCCN CE analytic paradigm.",cancer"American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, Associazione Medici Endocrinologi, and European Thyroid Association medical guidelines for clinical practice for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules: executive summary of recommendations.

BACKGROUND: We report the development and assessment of a physical activity (PA) guidebook called Step Up to the Challenge that is being used to support a PA behavior change intervention in a randomized trial examining PA and disease-free survival in colon cancer survivors. METHODS: Content for the PA guidebook was constructed based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Expert judges (N = 51) included oncologists, rehabilitation practitioners, colon cancer survivors, and TPB researchers. All expert judges completed the Maine Area Health Education Center checklist for evaluating written health information. A subset of TPB expert judges (n = 11) also assessed the degree of match between the guidebook content and TPB constructs. RESULTS: Expert judges indicated that the PA guidebook achieved desirable attributes for organization, writing style, appearance, appeal, feasibility, and appropriateness. For the TPB assessment, all mean item-content relevance ratings indicated at least a ""very good match"" between the PA guidebook content and the TPB constructs. CONCLUSIONS: Our guidebook successfully targets the TPB constructs known to influence PA behavior change and contains suitable and appropriate written health information. This guidebook will be an integral component of the behavioral support program designed to determine the effects of PA on disease-free survival in colon cancer survivors.",cancer"An acute exercise session increases self-efficacy in sedentary endometrial cancer survivors and controls. BACKGROUND: Self-efficacy can be affected by mastery experiences and somatic sensations. A novel exercise experience and associated sensations may impact self-efficacy and subsequent behaviors. We investigated the effect of a single exercise session on self-efficacy for sedentary endometrial cancer survivors compared with sedentary women of a similar age, but with no cancer history. METHODS: Twenty survivors and 19 controls completed an exercise session performed as a submaximal cycle ergometry test. Sensations and efficacy were measured before and after exercise. Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. Regression models were used to determine predictors of self-efficacy and subsequent exercise. RESULTS: Self-efficacy increased for both survivors and controls, but survivors had a higher rate of increase, and the change predicted subsequent exercise. The association between exercise-related somatic sensations and self-efficacy differed between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: A novel exercise experience had a larger effect on self-efficacy and subsequent exercise activity for endometrial cancer survivors than controls. Somatic sensations experienced during exercise may differ for survivors, which may be related to the experience of having cancer. Understanding factors affecting confidence in novel exercise experiences for populations with specific cancer histories is of the utmost importance in the adoption of exercise behaviors.",cancer"Necessity of bilateral bone marrow biopsies for ancillary cytogenetic studies in the pediatric population. The need for bilateral pediatric bone marrow biopsies for cytogenetic and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) studies has not been clearly delineated. We retrospectively identified 166 pediatric bilateral bone marrow biopsy specimens obtained from patients with a variety of clinical diagnoses, including solid tumors, lymphoma, leukemia, and other hematologic conditions. The cases included all pediatric bilateral bone marrow biopsies performed at our hospital spanning the years of 1992 to 2008. Agreement of FISH and classical cytogenetic results between the 2 sides was assessed. Of a total of 166 bilateral cases, 2 cases showed disagreement (1.2%), both from patients with solid tumors. One case was a rhabdomyosarcoma, in which FISH only was performed; the second was a neuroblastoma in which FISH and cytogenetics were performed (both FISH and classical cytogenetic results disagreed). The remainder of the cases showed complete agreement between the 2 sides (total 98.8%). We conclude that it is usually not necessary to perform bilateral bone marrow biopsies for FISH and cytogenetics in the pediatric population outside of the setting of solid tumor staging.",cancer"Transformation of follicular lymphoma to plasmablastic lymphoma with c-myc gene rearrangement. Follicular lymphoma (FL) is an indolent lymphoma that transforms to high-grade lymphoma, mostly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, in about a third of patients. We present the first report of a case of FL that transformed to plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL). Clonal transformation of the FL to PBL was evidenced by identical IGH/BCL2 gene rearrangements and VDJ gene usage in rearranged IGH genes. IGH/ BCL2 translocation was retained in the PBL, which also acquired c-myc gene rearrangement. Genealogic analysis based on somatic hypermutation of the rearranged IGH genes of both FL and PBL suggests that transformation of the FL to PBL occurred most likely by divergent evolution from a common progenitor cell rather than direct evolution from the FL clone. Our study of this unusual case expands the histologic spectrum of FL transformation and increases our understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms of transformation of indolent lymphomas to aggressive lymphomas.",cancer"Aspiration cytomorphology of fetal adenocarcinoma of the lung. Fetal adenocarcinoma (FA) of the lung is an exceedingly rare malignancy. Many patients with the well-differentiated form are relatively young and with the high-grade variant are older. We describe the cases of 4 women with FA examined by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Aspirates were moderately cellular with malignant, mostly aggregated cells. Glands and acini were present. The columnar neoplastic epithelial cells had homogeneous round nuclei with fine chromatin, smooth membranes, and indistinct nucleoli. With the rapid Romanowsky stain, subnuclear vacuoles were evident in some tumor cells; at times, this was associated with a focal extracellular tigroid pattern. Morule formation was present in the 3 specimens. Immunochemically, all tumors manifested epithelial and neuroendocrine differentiation. Cytomorphologic attributes included the following: (1) distinct subnuclear vacuoles, sometimes with an associated tigroid picture; (2) small, uniform, round nuclei; (3) morules; and (4) neuroendocrine differentiation in glandular epithelial cells.",cancer"Lack of HER2 overexpression and amplification in small intestinal adenocarcinoma. HER2 overexpression and amplification have been studied as a therapeutic and prognostic target in a number of human cancers, including esophageal, gastric, and colorectal adenocarcinomas. However, HER2 status has not been well investigated in primary small intestinal adenocarcinoma, probably because of its rarity. In this study, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for HER2 on 49 primary nonampullar small intestinal adenocarcinomas. The results showed a complete lack of HER2 protein expression in 47 cases (96%) by immunohistochemical analysis. Only 2 cases (4%) showed a 1+ staining pattern. No tumors exhibited 2+ or 3+ HER2 immunoreactivity. By FISH, none of the tumors, including those with 1+ HER2 immunoreactivity, exhibited HER2 gene amplification. These observations demonstrate that HER2 protein overexpression and gene amplification are infrequent events, if they occur at all, in small intestinal adenocarcinoma. Thus, routine immunohistochemical and/or FISH testing for HER2 for potential targeted anti-HER2 therapy may not be beneficial for patients with primary small intestinal adenocarcinoma.",cancer"Molecular and immunohistologic analyses cannot reliably solve diagnostic variation of flat intraepithelial lesions of the urinary bladder. We examined diagnostic variation of flat intraurothelial lesions with comparison with immunohistochemical and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses. Nine uropathologists diagnosed 23 biopsy samples from the urinary bladder. The samples were analyzed by immunohistochemical expression of cytokeratin 20, high-molecular-weight cytokeratin, Ki-67, p53, and p16(INK4a), and multicolor FISH using the UroVysion probe set (Vysis, Abbott, Des Plaines, IL). Diagnostic agreement for each classification and for nonneoplastic or neoplastic lesions was obtained in 8 (35%) and 16 (70%) of 23 lesions, respectively. The preference ratio of neoplasia to nonneoplasia (0.9 to 4.8) or carcinoma in situ to dysplasia (0.2 to 4.0) also varied among the pathologists. In 6 ancillary analyses, the majority of neoplastic lesions with diagnostic agreement indicated more than 2 aberrant results, whereas the majority of lesions without diagnostic agreement showed no or only 1 aberrant result. The molecular and immunohistochemical analyses can discriminate between neoplastic and nonneoplastic lesions; however, they cannot reliably solve diagnostic variation of flat intraepithelial lesions.",cancer"Neurological complications of systemic cancer. Neurological complications of systemic cancer-those arising outside the nervous system-can be distressing, disabling, and sometimes fatal. Diagnosis is often difficult because different neurological disorders may present with similar signs and symptoms. Furthermore, comorbid neurological illnesses, common in elderly patients with cancer, can complicate diagnosis. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment can improve neurological symptoms and can substantially enhance a patient's quality of life. We approach the problem of neurological complications of systemic cancer as would a neurologist: first by identifying the anatomical area or areas that are affected (ie, brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve), then by evaluating the diagnostic approach, considering the symptoms and signs and including appropriate laboratory tests, and finally, by recommending treatment. We focus on disorders that are difficult to diagnose, need neurological consultation, and for which effective treatments exist.",cancer"Minimally invasive diagnosis of sarcoidosis by EBUS when conventional diagnostics fail. BACKGROUND: Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial fine-needle aspiration (EBUS) is a minimally invasive method used routinely for mediastinal staging of patients with lung cancer. EBUS has also proved to be a valuable diagnostic tool for patients with different intrathoracic lesions who remain undiagnosed despite bronchoscopy and CT-guided fine-needle aspiration. OBJECTIVE: The present study focused on EBUS for diagnosing sarcoidosis. DESIGN: During a 3-year period 308 of 601 patients who underwent EBUS at our institution were referred for further diagnostic of a radiologically suspicious lesion in the lung parenchyma (n = 195), enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum (n = 89), a suspicious tumor in the mediastinum or pleural disease (n = 24) but no one had a definite histological diagnosis. All charts were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: Of the 308 patients 43 (14%) were eventually diagnosed with sarcoidosis. Thirty-three (77%) were diagnosed with EBUS. In the remaining 10 patients EBUS did not provide adequate tissue samples in 4 (9%) and in 6 patients (14%) EBUS provided adequate tissue but no definite diagnosis. EBUS was significantly better to establish the diagnosis in patients with enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes compared with isolated lung parenchymal involvement (85% vs 63%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: EBUS is a valuable minimally invasive diagnostic modality to establish the diagnosis of sarcoidosis of unselected patients with undiagnosed intrathoracic lesions after conventional work up--particularly if patients have enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. This minimally invasive procedure provides a final diagnosis without exposing the patient to the risk of complications from more invasive procedures.",cancer"Preventing and managing vesicant chemotherapy extravasations. Although vesicant chemotherapy extravasations cannot be entirely prevented, the risk of extravasation can be reduced by adhering to guidelines for safe vesicant administration. These include engaging patients in extravasation-prevention efforts, thoroughly assessing patients receiving vesicants, selecting an appropriate administration site for peripheral vesicant administration, and checking for a blood return prior to and during vesicant administration. In addition, whenever an extravasation occurs or is suspected, vesicant administration must immediately cease, and the appropriate antidote or treatment needs to be promptly administered.",cancer"Longitudinal effects of social support and adaptive coping on the emotional well-being of survivors of localized prostate cancer. Survivors of prostate cancer experience treatment-related physical side effects that can compromise emotional well-being for years post-treatment. There is limited research investigating how social support and the use of coping may affect the emotional well-being of this population following treatment. The aim of this study was to investigate how social support and coping impact emotional well-being 2 years after treatment in survivors of localized prostate cancer who have received either radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy. Psychosocial and disease-specific measures were administered to an ethnically and demographically diverse sample of 180 men treated for localized prostate cancer at baseline and at 2-year follow-up. Regression analyses demonstrated that higher levels of social support at baseline predicted better emotional well-being 2 years later. Furthermore, higher levels of adaptive coping at baseline partially mediated the relationship between social support and emotional well-being. Supportive relationships may contribute to improved emotional well-being following treatment by facilitating the use of adaptive coping strategies. Attention should be given to strengthening social support networks and educating survivors of prostate cancer on adaptive coping techniques.",cancer"Obtaining data on comorbid diabetes among patients in a U.S. population-based tumor registry. Comorbid diabetes mellitus has been shown to be associated with outcomes among cancer patients, but population-based data have been limited to elderly patients through linkages between the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program database and Medicare databases. Reporting of comorbidity to the population-based Connecticut SEER registry is not required, but the extent of voluntary reporting of comorbid diabetes was assessed in this preliminary study. Of 15,145 Connecticut residents diagnosed at age 20+ years with invasive cancer in 2006, who were ascertained from 33 registry sources, 8688 (57.4%) from 21 sources were included in the analysis of comorbid diabetes. The prevalence of comorbid diabetes was 12.5%, and was lowest for patients with prostate cancer (8.5%) and highest for with liver-pancreas cancer (25.9%), consistent with the literature. Diabetes prevalence was substantial (9.5%) within the non-elderly subgroup aged 20-64 years at cancer diagnosis who comprised 45% of the 8688 patients. These results indicate an opportunity for future large-scale studies of the impact of diabetes on outcomes among all newly diagnosed cancer patients (both non-elderly and elderly) in the Connecticut SEER registry and other US central cancer registries.",cancer"Improving geocoding outcomes for the Nebraska Cancer Registry: learning from proven practices. This report summarizes geocoding improvement experiments in the Nebraska Cancer Registry. An initial assessment of previous geocoding suggests that some proven geocoding procedures have not been followed, and overall results were unacceptable. This study concluded that when updating different address files from different time periods, it is sufficient to use the most recent street centerline database. The combination of match score of 80 and spelling sensitivity of 80 in ESRI's ArcGIS geocoder is sufficient for most geocoding purposes. Given the sizable number of unmatched addresses, the Google Maps geocoding service was used. A comparison of 1500 high-quality addresses that were matched by both Google Maps and ArcGIS geocoders shows that, in most cases, the location discrepancies between the two were acceptable. The median distance between each pair of 1500 coded locations was 36.6 meters, with an average of 92.8 meters. Distance discrepancies were larger in urban fringe areas and smaller toward urban centers. It was concluded that by strictly following proven procedures including address coding specification, Internet-based White Pages for reverse address finding, and Internet-based geocoding, a 90% or even a 95% match rate is achievable.",cancer"The relationship between methylation of the Syk gene in the promoter region and the genesis of lung cancer. BACKGROUND: To study the expression of the Syk (Spleen Tyrosine Kinase) gene and methylation in its promoter region in lung cancer. To investigate the relationship between silencing of the Syk gene and DNA methylation of the Syk promoter region. METHODS: RT-PCR (Semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR), Real-time PCR (Real-time quantitative PCR) and immunohistochemistry technique, the expression of Syk in specimens from 3 lung cancer cell lines and 16 lung cancer patients (tumor tissues and adjacent normal tissues). MSP (Methylation-specific PCR) was used to analyze the methylation status of the Syk promoter region. Then we also investigated the role of restoring Syk expression by using a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor, 5-aza-CdR (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine), in suppressing invasion of lung cell lines. RESULTS: No expression of the Syk gene was detected in the 3 lung cancer cell lines. In the 16 lung patient samples, Syk expression was significantly lower in the tumor tissues than in the adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.05). Consistently, immunohistochemistry analyses of Syk protein expression showed that in the cancer tissues Syk protein expression accounted for 5% (1/20), and in the adjacent normal tissues the rate of expression was 100% (20/20). The correlation was highly significant (chi2 = 36.19, P < 0.005). In the only case that showed a positive expression of cancer textus, the level was inferior to the adjacent tissue. In the two lung cancer cell lines (L9981, A549) that lack the endogenous Syk epression, 4uM demethylation agent 5-aza-CdR treatment was able to reactivate the Syk gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Hypermethylation leads to silencing of the Syk gene in human lung carcinoma. Methylation of the Syk promoter and loss of Syk expression in lung cancer are independent biomarkers, a determination which may offer guidance for selecting appropriate diagnoses and treatments. Syk may be a potential tumor suppressor in human lung cancer.",cancer"Hemoperitoneum caused by a bleeding myoma in pregnancy. The prevalence of uterine myomas during pregnancy is estimated to range from 0.3% to 2.6%. Although leiomyomas usually remain asymptomatic, in one often cases they may be complicated. The management of uterine fibroids during pregnancy is largely conservative and surgical removal is generally delayed until post partum. A 37-year-old pregnant woman (15 weeks) with a history of gynecologic examination several hours before presented with lower abdominal pain and signs of acute abdomen. She was para-2, as she had delivered a healthy child 12 years before, and current pregnancy was uncomplicated until presentation. Intra-abdominal hemorrhage was suspected and she underwent immediate exploratory laparotomy, which revealed massive hemoperitoneum. A subserous uterine leiomyoma of 8.5x6.5 cm was found in the fundus area, with an actively bleeding ruptured vessel on its dome. Myomectomy was successfully performed and 1.5 liter of blood and blood clots were evacuated from the peritoneal cavity. The histology report showed sections of interlacing bundles of smooth muscles with areas of bleeding and necrotic degeneration. The postoperative course and subsequent antenatal period were uneventful. The woman went into spontaneous labor at 38 weeks and delivered vaginally a healthy male baby. This rare case ofintra-abdominal hemorrhage due to bleeding myoma supports other recent studies, which have demonstrated that myomectomy may be successfully performed during pregnancy in selected circumstances.",cancer"Synchronous rectal adenocarcinoma and bilateral clear cell renal carcinoma. A 69-year-old man was admitted for resection of rectal adenocarcinoma diagnosed by colonoscopy. Preoperative computed tomography scan and abdominal ultrasonography revealed bilateral renal tumors measuring up to 2 and 2.8 cm in largest diameter, respectively. The patient underwent partial colectomy and bilateral partial nephrectomy. Microscopically, rectal adenocarcinoma penetrated the submucosa, without invasion of the muscularis propria. Both renal tumors were clear cell renal carcinomas of Fuhrmann nuclear grade 2. To our knowledge, this is the first case of synchronous adenocarcinoma of the rectum and bilateral clear cell renal cell carcinoma described in the literature to date.",cancer"Increases in quantitative D-dimer levels correlate with progressive disease better than circulating tumor cell counts in patients with refractory prostate cancer. Changes in quantitative D-dimer levels, circulating tumor cell (CTC) counts, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels were measured in 28 patients with refractory castration-resistant prostate cancer to assess their concordance during the course of therapy and their relationship with risk of progressive disease. A significant correlation was identified between changes in PSA and both CTC counts and D-dimer levels (r = 0.67 and 0.58, respectively; P < .001). In addition, there was a significant correlation between changes in CTC count and D-dimer level (r = 0.62; P < .001). A significantly stronger concordance between these biomarkers was noted for increasing values (sensitivity, 72%-77.8%) compared with decreasing values (specificity, 43.8%-71.4%). Notably, increases in PSA and D-dimer levels, not CTC counts, were associated with increased risks for progressive disease (P < .024). Increases in quantitative D-dimer levels correlate with progressive disease better than CTC counts in patients with refractory prostate cancer.",cancer"A new approach for identifying patients with ovarian epithelial neoplasms based on high-resolution mass spectrometry. We investigated the serum profiles of patients with ovarian neoplasm using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to obtain serum ""fingerprints"" for use in identifying patients with these neoplasms. We used HPLC-HRMS to analyze serum samples from patients with ovarian neoplasms and control subjects. Serum samples from 145 patients were analyzed, including 85 with ovarian epithelial neoplasms. We also compared the results of this serum-fingerprinting approach with the results of the CA-125 test and imaging. Fingerprinting successfully permitted the separation of control patients and patients with ovarian neoplasms. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were between 96% and 100%. When the results of this test were concordant with the results of the CA-125 test, 99% of serum samples were correctly classified as being from a patient with an ovarian neoplasm or with no ovarian neoplasm. We found that a metabolite of molecular weight 472 is the main metabolite in the separation of patients with ovarian neoplasms from control subjects. HPLC-HRMS serum profiling could become a screening test for ovarian neoplasms.",cancer"Carbonic anhydrase IX expression in renal neoplasms: correlation with tumor type and grade. Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), a hypoxia-induced protein, is expressed in some renal tumors. We evaluated its immunohistochemical expression in 317 primary and 42 metastatic renal neoplasms (186 clear cell, 52 papillary, 35 chromophobe, 47 unclassified, and 15 Xp11.2 translocation renal cell carcinomas [RCCs]; 26 oncocytomas; 2 metanephric adenomas; 1 urothelial carcinoma; 1 mixed epithelial and stromal tumor; and 1 angiomyolipoma); 7 neoplasms were unknown as to whether they were primary or metastatic. We also correlated expression with tumor type and grade. Variable staining was seen in clear cell, papillary, unclassified, and Xp11.2 translocation carcinomas. One chromophobe carcinoma had focal expression. No staining was seen with other tumors. An association was found between high expression and clear cell vs non-clear cell carcinomas with all cases (P < .01) and primary (P < .01) cases. An association between CAIX expression and grade (P < .01) in primary clear cell carcinomas was found. CAIX expression is more common in clear cell RCC than other renal tumor types and is associated with grade.",cancer"Dimensional versus categorical use of the PHQ-9 depression scale among persons with non-small-cell lung cancer: a pilot study including quality-of-life comparisons. The debate over the relative usefulness of categorical (yes/no) versus dimensional (continuous scales) assessments for determining mental illness has been running strong for nearly a half century. In order to address the utility of each of these assessment methods within the cancer population, in the present study, the dimensional and categorical scoring systems of the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression were compared among patients (n = 14) in the pretreatment stages for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Also included in the study was an additional dimensional measure of depression, the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). As predicted, dimensional assessments resulted in higher estimates of depression than did the categorical assessment. As predicted, the dimensional depression assessments, including the PHQ-9 and the BDI-II, which showed depression prevalence rates of 43% and 36%, respectively, produced higher estimates of depression than did the categorical system of the PHQ-9, whose use did not result in any patients being diagnosed with major depression or other depression. Also, as predicted, in terms of quality of life, patients found to be depressed by both the BDI-II and the dimensional PHQ-9 reported significantly worse physical, functional, and emotional well-being than did their nondepressed counterparts. Study findings suggest a need for further investigation into the possibility that patients who score highly on the dimensional scoring system of the PHQ-9 but at values below threshold on the more commonly accepted categorical scoring system of the same measure would benefit from consideration for psychotherapeutic treatment.",cancer"A prospective crossover pilot study to evaluate the use of a topical wound gel in patients with cutaneous toxicity caused by epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors. One of the dose-limiting toxicities of epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (EGFRIs) is a papulopustular rash that is often pruritic and painful. Secondary skin infection can occur from scratching to relieve the pruritus. Studies suggest that this rash might be a surrogate marker for efficacy; therefore, effective rash management is needed to allow patients to use EGFRIs without unnecessary dose modifications. In this single-center, prospective, crossover study, we evaluated the use of a topical gel (Regenecare Wound Gel) for relieving the pruritus and pain of EGFRI-induced rash among oncology patients. The secondary end points were patient satisfaction, adverse effects, and EGFRI dose modifications. At the occurrence of grade 2 skin rash, patients started applying the study gel to the right side of their face; after 1 week, they began applying it to both sides of their face for up to an additional 5 weeks. Each week, providers performed a facial evaluation and patients rated their symptoms and satisfaction on questionnaires. Of the 20 patients enrolled, 13 were evaluable. Reduction in itch at the end of week 1 was greater on the right (treated) side in 69% of patients greater on the left (untreated) side in 8%, and the same in 23% (P = 0.01). The pattern was similar for pain, but the differences were not significant. On average, patients rated the gel as being moderately to extremely effective for alleviating symptoms, improving rash appearance, and promoting healing and found it easy to apply. No adverse effects were documented. Four patients (31%) required EGFRI dose modifications because of rash. Taken together, these findings suggest that the topical wound gel is effective in relieving rash-associated itching in patients receiving EGFRIs and is associated with high patient satisfaction.",cancer"Including self-reported race to improve cancer surveillance data for American Indians and Alaska Natives in Washington state. BACKGROUND: American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) are frequently misclassified as another race in cancer surveillance systems, resulting in underestimated morbidity and mortality. Linkage methods with administrative records have been used to correct AI/AN misclassification, but AI/AN populations living in urban areas, and those who self-identify as AI/AN race, continue to be under-ascertained. The aim of this study was to evaluate racial misclassification in two cancer registries in Washington State using an urban AI/AN patient roster linked with a list of Indian Health Service (IHS) enrollees. METHODS: We conducted probabilistic record linkages to identify racial misclassification using a combined demographic dataset of self-identified AI/AN patients of a large, urban Indian health center, and administratively-identified AI/AN enrolled with the IHS. Age-adjusted incidence rates were calculated for 3 linkage populations: AI/ AN originally coded in each cancer registry, post-linkage AI/AN identified through the IHS roster alone, and post-linkage AI/AN identified through either the urban or IHS file. RESULTS: In the state and regional cancer registries, 11% and 18%, respectively, of matched cases were originally coded as a race other than AI/AN; approximately 35% of these were identified by the urban file alone. Incidence rate estimates increased after linkage with the IHS file, and further increased with the addition of urban records. Matches identified by the urban patient file resulted in the largest relative incidence change being demonstrated for King County (which includes Seattle); the all-site invasive cancer rate increased 8.8%, from 443 to 482 per 100,000. CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of urban and self-identified AI/AN records can increase case ascertainment in cancer surveillance systems beyond linkage methods using only administrative sources.",cancer"A case of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gallbladder: immunohistochemistry and differential diagnosis. The morphological spectrum of gallbladder carcinoma is broad and variable. Most of these tumors are tubular adenocarcinomas. There are some tumors with unusual morphology that may be difficult to classify due to their rarity. One of such tumors is the signet-ring cell carcinoma, which is a highly aggressive, mucin producing variant of gallbladder adenocarcinoma predominantly or exclusively composed of signet-ring cells. Histologically, these tumors are similar to their counterparts in other organs such as stomach, colon and breast, and should not be misinterpreted as metastatic carcinoma from one of these primary sites. The literature about this variant of carcinoma is sparse and little is known about it. We found only three cases of signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gallbladder previously reported. We present the case of an 86-year-old woman with signet-ring cell carcinoma of the gallbladder and discuss the potential diagnostic dilemmas",cancer"Brain tumors and epilepsy. Brain tumors are a common cause of epilepsy. Tumor type and location are determining factors that significantly influence seizure frequency. The aim of this study was to analyze clinical data of patients diagnosed with brain tumors and epilepsy. Data for this study were obtained from patient medical records over a 6-year period (2000-2005). Patient history and findings obtained by diagnostic methods such as electroencephalography, computerized tomography and magnetic resonance were analyzed. Data were analyzed by appropriate statistical methods and the structure, prevalence, mean and standard deviation were calculated. The significance of results was tested by use of t-test and chi2-test. A total of 15 933 patient charts were analyzed. Out of 15 933 patients, 10.8% were diagnosed with epilepsy and 175 (1.09%) patients had brain tumor, 75 (42.86%) of which were significantly associated with epilepsy (P > 0.05). Almost forty-three percent (42.86%) of tumors were epileptogenic, with no significant sex difference (confidence level of 95%). Fifty-seven (32.5%) brain tumor patients were aged 51-60. The mean age of all patients with brain tumors was 41.6 years. Focal sensorimotor seizures were dominant in 40 (53.3%) cases. Among epilepsy cases with known etiology, 75 (6.8%) patients had epileptogenic tumors. Types of seizures in patients with epilepsy were different from seizures provoked by brain tumors. The most common tumor site was temporal region (43.4%). There was no significant difference according to epileptogenesis. Focal sensorimotor seizures were common in patients with frontal and parietal region tumors.",cancer"Diverse phenotypic profile of uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors: an immunohistochemical study of 12 cases. BACKGROUND: Uterine tumors resembling ovarian sex cord tumors (UTROSCTs) are rare neoplasms thought to be of putative endometrial stromal origin and solely composed of sex cord elements. Our study aimed to delineate the immunophenotype of these tumors and to verify whether their morphology reflects true sex cord-like differentiation. DESIGN: Representative paraffin blocks from 12 UTROSCTs were selected after confirmation of the diagnosis. Cords and/or trabeculae were seen in all tumors, whereas tubules, diffuse areas, and a retiform pattern were present in 9, 6, and 2 cases, respectively. Tumors were stained for sex cord (inhibin, calretinin, WT1, and melan-A), epithelial (KL1 and epithelial membrane antigen), and smooth muscle markers (smooth muscle actin, desmin, smooth muscle myosin heavy chain, h-caldesmon, and histone deacetylase-8), CD10, HMB45, S100, and CD117. Intensity and percentage of staining were recorded. RESULTS: Six out of 12 tumors were positive for sex cord markers (inhibin 3 of 12, calretinin 4 of 12, WT1 4 of 12, and melan-A 3 of 11) with 4 tumors coexpressing more than one marker. Half of the UTROSCTs showed positivity for KL1, with 2 tumors coexpressing epithelial membrane antigen. All but one tumor expressed one or more smooth muscle markers, with smooth muscle actin, desmin and histone deacetylase-8 being most commonly expressed. CD10 was positive in 6 of 12 tumors, CD117 in 4 of 12, and S100 in 2 of 11 tumors, whereas HMB45 was negative in 11 tumors tested. CONCLUSIONS: UTROSCTs have a diverse immunohistochemical profile often coexpressing sex cord, epithelial, and smooth muscle markers. The expression of smooth muscle markers in these tumors does not imply a smooth muscle origin as endometrial and sex cord stromal tumors are not infrequently positive for these markers. Positivity for sex cord markers supports a true sex cord/steroid phenotype. Although the immunohistochemical profile of these tumors overlaps with that of endometrial stromal tumors with sex cord-like differentiation as well as ovarian sex cord stromal tumors, the origin of UTROSCT remains uncertain.",cancer"Intra-ampullary papillary-tubular neoplasm (IAPN): characterization of tumoral intraepithelial neoplasia occurring within the ampulla: a clinicopathologic analysis of 82 cases. BACKGROUND: There has been no uniform terminology for systematic analysis of mass-forming preinvasive neoplasms (which we term tumoral intraepithelial neoplasia) that occur specifically within the ampulla. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of these neoplasms, which we propose to refer to as intra-ampullary papillary-tubular neoplasm (IAPN). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three hundred and seventeen glandular neoplasms involving the ampulla were identified through a review of 1469 pancreatoduodenectomies and 11 ampullectomies. Eighty-two neoplasms characterized by substantial preinvasive exophytic component that grew almost exclusively (>75%) within the ampulla (in the ampullary channel or intra-ampullary portions of the very distal segments of the common bile duct or pancreatic duct) were analyzed. RESULTS: (1) Clinical: The mean age was 64 years, male/female ratio was 2.4, and mean tumor size was 2.7 cm. (2) Pathology: The tumors had a mixture of both papillary and tubular growth (each constituting at least 25% of the lesion) in 57%; predominantly (>75%) papillary in 23%, and predominantly (>75%) tubular in 20%. High-grade dysplasia was present in 94% of cases, of which 39% showed focal (<25% of the lesion), 28% showed substantial (25% to 75%), and 27% showed extensive (>75%) high-grade dysplasia. In terms of cell-lineage morphology, 45% had a mixture of patterns. However, when evaluated with a forced-binary approach as intestinal (INT) versus gastric/pancreatobiliary (GPB) based on the predominant pattern, 74% were classified as INT and 26% as GPB. (3) Immunohistochemistry: Percent sensitivity/specificity of cell-lineage markers were, for INT phenotype: MUC2 85/78 and CDX2 94/61; and for GBP: MUC1 89/79, MUC5AC 95/69, and MUC6 83/76, respectively. Cytokeratin 7 and 20 were coexpressed in more than half. (4) Invasive carcinoma: In 64 cases (78%), there was an associated invasive carcinoma. Size of the tumor and amount of dysplasia correlated with the incidence of invasion. Invasive carcinoma was of INT-type in 58% and of pancreatobiliary-type in 42%. Cell lineage in the invasive component was the same as that of the preinvasive component in 84%. All discrepant cases were pancreatobiliary-type invasions, which occurred in INT-type preinvasive lesions. (5) Outcome: The overall survival of invasive cases were significantly worse than that of noninvasive ones (57% vs. 93%; P=0.01); and 3 years, 69% versus 100% (P=0.08); and 5 years, 45% versus 100% (P=0.07), respectively. When compared with 166 conventional invasive carcinomas of the ampullary region, invasive IAPNs had significantly better prognosis with a mean survival of 51 versus 31 months (P<0.001) and the 3-year survival of 69% versus 44% (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Tumoral intraepithelial neoplasia occurring within the ampulla are highly analogous to pancreatic or biliary intraductal papillary and tubular neoplasms as evidenced by their papillary and/or tubular growth, variable cell lineage, and spectrum of dysplastic change (adenoma-carcinoma sequence), and thus we propose to refer to these as IAPN. IAPNs are biologically indolent; noninvasive examples show an excellent prognosis, whereas those with invasion exhibit a malignant but nevertheless significantly better prognosis than typical invasive ampullary carcinomas unaccompanied by IAPNs. Twenty eight percent (64 of 230) of invasive carcinomas within the ampulla arise in association with IAPNs.",cancer"Mutations in GNA11 in uveal melanoma. BACKGROUND: Uveal melanoma is the most common intraocular cancer. There are no effective therapies for metastatic disease. Mutations in GNAQ, the gene encoding an alpha subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, are found in 40% of uveal melanomas. METHODS: We sequenced exon 5 of GNAQ and GNA11, a paralogue of GNAQ, in 713 melanocytic neoplasms of different types (186 uveal melanomas, 139 blue nevi, 106 other nevi, and 282 other melanomas). We sequenced exon 4 of GNAQ and GNA11 in 453 of these samples and in all coding exons of GNAQ and GNA11 in 97 uveal melanomas and 45 blue nevi. RESULTS: We found somatic mutations in exon 5 (affecting Q209) and in exon 4 (affecting R183) in both GNA11 and GNAQ, in a mutually exclusive pattern. Mutations affecting Q209 in GNA11 were present in 7% of blue nevi, 32% of primary uveal melanomas, and 57% of uveal melanoma metastases. In contrast, we observed Q209 mutations in GNAQ in 55% of blue nevi, 45% of uveal melanomas, and 22% of uveal melanoma metastases. Mutations affecting R183 in either GNAQ or GNA11 were less prevalent (2% of blue nevi and 6% of uveal melanomas) than the Q209 mutations. Mutations in GNA11 induced spontaneously metastasizing tumors in a mouse model and activated the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. CONCLUSIONS: Of the uveal melanomas we analyzed, 83% had somatic mutations in GNAQ or GNA11. Constitutive activation of the pathway involving these two genes appears to be a major contributor to the development of uveal melanoma.

CONTEXT: In a randomized phase 3 trial, 400 mg of sorafenib twice daily prolonged overall survival of patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child-Pugh A disease. In a phase 1 study, sorafenib combined with doxorubicin, 60 mg/m(2), was well tolerated by patients with refractory solid tumors. The combination of sorafenib and doxorubicin in patients with advanced HCC has not been evaluated in a phase 2 or 3 trial. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of doxorubicin plus sorafenib compared with doxorubicin alone in patients with advanced HCC and Child-Pugh A disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: In a double-blind phase 2 multinational study, conducted from April 2005 to October 2006, 96 patients (76% male; median age, 65 years [range, 38-82 years]) with advanced HCC, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, Child-Pugh A status, and no prior systemic therapy were randomly assigned to receive 60 mg/m(2) of doxorubicin intravenously every 21 days plus either 400 mg of sorafenib or placebo orally twice a day. The date of the last patient's follow-up was April 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Time to progression as determined by independent review. RESULTS: Following complete accrual, an unplanned early analysis for efficacy was performed by the independent data monitoring committee, so the trial was halted. The 2 patients remaining in the placebo group at that time were offered sorafenib. Based on 51 progressions, 63 deaths, and 70 events for progression-free survival, median time to progression was 6.4 months in the sorafenib-doxorubicin group (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.8-9.2), and 2.8 months (95% CI, 1.6-5) in the doxorubicin-placebo monotherapy group (P = .02). Median overall survival was 13.7 months (95% CI, 8.9--not reached) and 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.5-9.9; P = .006), and progression-free survival was 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.6-8.6) and 2.7 months (95% CI, 1.4-2.8) in these groups, respectively (P = .006). Toxicity profiles were similar to those for the single agents. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with advanced HCC, treatment with sorafenib plus doxorubicin compared with doxorubicin monotherapy resulted in greater median time to progression, overall survival, and progression-free survival. The degree to which this improvement may represent synergism between sorafenib and doxorubicin remains to be defined. The combination of sorafenib and doxorubicin is not yet indicated for routine clinical use.

National guidelines recommend that primary care providers discuss the risks and benefits of prostate cancer screening with their patients but give little guidance on how to fit such a complex discussion into a busy clinic encounter. The authors propose a process-oriented approach (Ask-Tell-Ask) that promotes tailored conversations and value-based recommendations. The Ask-Tell-Ask approach includes diagnosing a patient's informational needs, providing targeted education based on those needs, and making a shared decision about testing. This time-efficient model emphasizes the provider's role as an interactive guide rather than a one-way supplier of information. Although there is no way to make these discussions simple, this streamlined strategy can help patients and providers efficiently negotiate the complex and important decision of screening for prostate cancer.",cancer"Transoral robotic surgery for advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. OBJECTIVES: To determine the oncologic and functional outcomes in patients undergoing primary transoral robotic surgery followed by adjuvant therapy as indicated with a minimum of 18-month follow-up for advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. DESIGN: Prospective single-center cohort study. SETTING: Academic university health system and tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Forty-seven adults with newly diagnosed and previously untreated advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma. INTERVENTION: Transoral robotic surgery with staged neck dissection and adjuvant therapy as indicated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Margin status, recurrence, disease-specific and disease-free survival, gastrostomy tube dependence, and safety and efficacy end points. RESULTS: In the 47 patients enrolled with stages III and IV advanced oropharyngeal carcinoma, mean follow-up was 26.6 months. There was no intraoperative or postoperative mortality. Resection margins were positive in 1 patient (2%). At last follow-up, local recurrence was identified in 1 patient (2%), regional recurrence in 2 (4%), and distant recurrence in 4 (9%). Disease-specific survival was 98% (45 of 46 patients) at 1 year and 90% (27 of 30 patients) at 2 years. Based on pathologic risk stratification, 18 of 47 patients (38%) avoided chemotherapy, and 5 patients (11%) did not receive adjuvant radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy in their treatment regimen. At minimum follow-up of 1 year, only 1 patient required a gastrostomy tube. CONCLUSIONS: This novel transoral robotic surgery treatment regimen offers disease control, survival, and safety commensurate with standard treatments and an unexpected beneficial outcome of gastrostomy dependency rates that are markedly lower than those reported with standard nonsurgical therapies.",cancer"Neck dissection after chemoradiotherapy: timing and complications. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence of postchemoradiotherapy (post-CRT) neck dissection (ND) complications; to ascertain whether timing (< 12 vs >/= 12 weeks) from CRT to ND or other factors are associated with increased complications; and to determine whether ND timing influences disease control or survival. DESIGN: Ten-year retrospective analysis. SETTING: Tertiary care center. PATIENTS: One hundred five patients with head and neck cancer undergoing ND after CRT. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complications and survival variables compared between groups undergoing ND less than 12 weeks (less-than-12-weeks ND group) and 12 weeks or more (12-weeks-or-more ND group) after CRT. RESULTS: Sixty-seven NDs were performed less than 12 weeks and 38 were performed 12 weeks or more after CRT. Patient characteristics, treatment, and ND pathology results were comparable between the 2 ND groups. The incidence of complications between the less-than-12-weeks and the 12-weeks-or-more ND groups included major wound complications in 8 of 67 (11.9%) vs 1 of 38 (2.6%; P = .15), minor wound complications in 11 of 67 (16.4%) vs 4 of 38 (10.5%; P = .56), airway complications in 7 of 67 (10.4%) vs 2 of 38 (5.3%; P = .48), and systemic complications in 9 of 67 (13.4%) vs 2 of 38 (5.3%; P = .32). The number of patients with at least 1 complication was significantly smaller in the 12-weeks-or-more ND group (P = .04). Multivariate analysis showed that radical ND was significantly associated with an increased number of complications, and higher radiation doses approached significance (P = .05). Induction chemotherapy was associated with fewer wound complications (P = .01). There were no significant differences in overall survival (P = .82), progression-free survival (P = .77), or regional relapse (P = .54) between groups. Positive ND findings were associated with diminished progression-free and overall survival. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that ND can be safely performed 12 weeks or more after CRT without adversely affecting surgical complications or survival variables.",cancer"Hearing loss and complaint in patients with head and neck cancer treated with radiotherapy. OBJECTIVE: To investigate occurrences of hearing loss and hearing complaints among patients with head and neck tumors who underwent radiotherapy. DESIGN: Prospective case-control study. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred eighty-two participants underwent evaluation, including 141 with head and neck tumors and 141 as an age-matched control group. The controls had never undergone oncological treatment that put their hearing at risk. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Results of audiological evaluation, including the Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly questionnaire and pure-tone, speech, and immittance audiometry, and radiation dose received by the auditory system (based on the percentage of the external auditory canal included in the radiation field). RESULTS: We observed occurrences of hearing loss in 102 (72.3%) of the participants exposed to radiotherapy and 69 (48.9%) of the control group (P < .001). Hearing losses were mostly sensorineural and of mild degree, but those exposed to radiotherapy more frequently presented with severe and mixed-type hearing losses (P < .001). Of the participants exposed to radiotherapy, 19.1% had a severe handicap (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Patients undergoing radiotherapy in the head and neck region have a higher incidence of hearing loss and more severe hearing handicap.

OBJECTIVE: To further understanding of treatment of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). DESIGN: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program database was searched for patients who had undergone surgery for PTC. SETTING: Areas covered by Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results population-based registries. PATIENTS: Patients who had undergone PTC surgery between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 2001, were included in the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-specific survival (DSS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Of the total 22,724 patients with PTC, 5964 patients underwent lobectomy. There were 2138 total and 471 disease-specific deaths. Controlling for tumor size, multivariate analysis revealed no survival difference between patients who had undergone total thyroidectomy and those who had undergone lobectomy. Increased tumor size, extrathyroidal extent, positive nodal status, and increased age displayed significantly worse DSS and OS (P < .001). Histologically, follicular PTC subtype did not affect DSS or OS. Patients who had received radioactive iodine had poorer DSS but improved OS. Patients undergoing external beam radiation therapy had poor DSS (hazard ratio, 4.48; 95% confidence interval, 3.30-6.06; P < .001) and OS (1.71; 1.42-2.07; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study compel us to reinvestigate the current PTC surgical recommendations of total thyroidectomy based on tumor size because this may not affect survival across all populations. In addition, the current use of external beam radiation therapy for the treatment of PTC should be reexamined.",cancer"Laparoscopic vs open hepatic resection for benign and malignant tumors: An updated meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: To compare laparoscopic hepatic resection (LHR) with open hepatic resection (OHR) for benign and malignant tumors. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, and EMBASE databases were searched for relevant studies published between January 1, 1998, and May 1, 2009. STUDY SELECTION: Studies clearly documenting a comparison of LHR with OHR for benign and malignant neoplasms were selected. DATA EXTRACTION: Operative and postoperative measures, resection margins, complications, and survival outcomes were evaluated. Weighted mean differences, relative risks, and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were included in the meta-analysis. The HR of death for malignant tumors was significantly lower in the LHR group compared with the OHR group (HR, 0.64; P = .04). The HR of recurrence for malignant tumors was not significantly different between the 2 groups (HR, 0.79; P = .37). The LHR group had a lower operative blood loss (weighted mean difference, -161 mL; P < .001) and relative risk of total postoperative complications (relative risk, 0.40; P < .001). Duration of hospital stay, days of intravenous narcotic use, and days until oral intake were all significantly lower in the LHR group compared with the OHR group. Operative time between LHR and OHR was not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic hepatic resection for malignant tumors is associated with a long-term survival that is at least comparable, if not superior, to OHR with no difference in disease recurrence. The use of LHR for benign and malignant tumors is a safe alternative to OHR with potential operative and postoperative benefits.",cancer"Risk factors for invasive breast cancer when core needle biopsy shows ductal carcinoma in situ. HYPOTHESIS: A core needle biopsy (CNB) diagnosis of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) may be associated with a final diagnosis of invasive cancer. Preoperative radiologic, clinical, and pathological features may identify patients at high risk of diagnostic upstaging, who may be appropriate candidates for sentinel node biopsy at initial surgery. DESIGN: Review of prospectively collected database. SETTING: Tertiary teaching referral hospital and a population-based breast screening center. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients from January 1, 1994, to December 31, 2006, whose CNB findings showed DCIS or DCIS with microinvasion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Upstaging to invasive cancer. RESULTS: Eleven of 15 cases of DCIS with microinvasion (73.3%) and 65 of 375 cases of DCIS (17.3%) were upstaged to invasive cancer. Ten of 21 palpable lesions (47.6%) were found to have microinvasion. For impalpable DCIS, multivariate analysis showed that noncalcific mammographic features (mass, architectural distortion, or nonspecific density) (odds ratio [95% confidence interval], 2.00 [1.02-3.94]), mammographic size of 20 mm or greater (2.80 [1.46-5.38]), and prolonged screening interval of 3 years or longer (4.41 [1.60-12.13]) were associated with upstaging. The DCIS grade on CNB was significant on univariate analysis (P = .04). The rate of upstaging increased with the number of significant factors present in a patient: 8.3% in patients with no risk factors, 20.8% in those with 1 risk factor, 39.6% in those with 2 risk factors, and 57.1% in those with 3 risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of upstaging can be estimated by using preoperative features in patients with DCIS on CNB. We propose a management algorithm that includes sentinel node biopsy for patients with DCIS who have microinvasion on CNB, palpable DCIS, 2 or more predictive factors, and planned total mastectomy.",cancer"Surgeon subspecialty as a factor in improving long-term outcomes for gastric cancer: Twenty years of experience in Korea. BACKGROUND: The results of gastric cancer treatment have improved during the past 2 decades. In addition to early diagnosis, surgeon experience and subspecialty may influence long-term outcomes. This study analyzed data accumulated during the past 20 years regarding the impact of surgical subspecialty on gastric cancer prognosis. DESIGN: A 20-year, retrospective study. SETTING: Korea University Guro Hospital, Seoul. PATIENTS: A total of 2797 patients admitted between 1984 and 2003 with surgically treated, pathologically confirmed, primary gastric adenocarcinoma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Long-term survival. RESULTS: The incidence of total gastrectomy and the number of retrieved lymph nodes increased during the study period. In curative cases, 5-year survival improved from 66.1% to 76.6%, and this survival gain was restricted to stages I, III, and IV. A Cox proportional hazards regression model showed that age, sex, tumor location, type of resection, stage, and the interaction between period of study and surgical subspecialty were independent prognostic factors. CONCLUSIONS: This large, long-term cohort study demonstrates that the management of gastric cancer has been largely successful, with favorable trends in prognostic factors. Successful outcomes are realized more often by gastric surgical specialists. Efforts must be made to improve the treatment of patients with stage II gastric cancer because the improvements in long-term results have plateaued.",cancer"Risk factors for lymphedema in a prospective breast cancer survivorship study: the Pathways Study. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL) during the early survivorship period as well as demographic, lifestyle, and clinical factors associated with BCRL development. DESIGN: The Pathways Study, a prospective cohort study of breast cancer survivors with a mean follow-up time of 20.9 months. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente Northern California medical care program. PARTICIPANTS: We studied 997 women diagnosed from January 9, 2006, through October 15, 2007, with primary invasive breast cancer and who were at least 21 years of age at diagnosis, had no history of any cancer, and spoke English, Spanish, Cantonese, or Mandarin. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Clinical indication for BCRL as determined from outpatient or hospitalization diagnostic codes, outpatient procedural codes, and durable medical equipment orders. RESULTS: A clinical indication for BCRL was found in 133 women (13.3%), with a mean time to diagnosis of 8.3 months (range, 0.7-27.3 months). Being African American (hazard ratio, 1.93; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-3.72) or more educated (P for trend = .03) was associated with an increased risk of BCRL. Removal of at least 1 lymph node (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.07) was associated with an increased risk, yet no significant association was observed for type of lymph node surgery. Being obese at breast cancer diagnosis was suggestive of an elevated risk (hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.88-2.31). CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort study, BCRL occurs among a substantial proportion of early breast cancer survivors. Our findings agree with those of previous studies on the increased risk of BCRL with removal of lymph nodes and being obese, but they point to a differential risk according to race or ethnicity.",cancer"Specific nail alterations in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma: successful treatment with topical mechlorethamine. BACKGROUND: Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma can be associated with clinically significant nail alterations, the presentation of which can be protean and misleading. To date, only a few reports have demonstrated direct specific tumor infiltration of the nail bed, while little is known about the efficacy of topical treatments. OBSERVATIONS: We describe the case of a 93-year-old man presenting with Sezary syndrome who developed clinically significant nail alterations. Light microscopy studies and T-cell receptor rearrangement analysis demonstrated the presence of a specific lymphocytic infiltrate within the nail bed. The patient was given repeated courses of topical mechlorethamine, leading to a sustained complete remission of both skin and nail alterations. CONCLUSIONS: Specific nail involvement should be recognized and considered in all patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Topical mechlorethamine remains an attractive therapeutic option in cases of specific nail alterations, especially for situations in which systemic therapies are either not indicated or unlikely to be well tolerated.",cancer"Thyrotoxicosis with pegylated interferon alfa-2b. BACKGROUND: Despite adequate surgery, a diagnosis of stage III melanoma carries a high risk of relapse, and hence mortality. Interferon alfa is the only treatment that has currently been shown to alter the natural history of the disease, delaying relapse-free survival, particularly in patients with micrometastatic disease. There is also recent evidence of a prognostic advantage conferred by the development of autoimmune conditions in patients receiving adjuvant interferon therapy. OBSERVATIONS: We present the case of a 27-year-old woman with stage IIIa melanoma who was entered into the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer 18991 trial of 5-year adjuvant treatment with pegylated interferon (peginterferon) alfa-2b. The patient developed thyrotoxicosis 3 months after commencing treatment, which required treatment with propylthiouracil. The degree of thyrotoxicosis corresponded closely to the dose of peginterferon alfa-2b given. However, in this patient, the hyperthyroidism resolved spontaneously after 4 years when peginterferon treatment was still ongoing. Seven years following the initial diagnosis, the patient has not had disease relapse. CONCLUSION: Hyperthyroidism is less common than hypothyroidism as a consequence of interferon therapy, and this case is atypical in that it resolved spontaneously during interferon therapy but is in accordance with the recent evidence of a positive association between interferon-associated autoimmunity and prognosis.",cancer"Dermoscopic island: a new descriptor for thin melanoma. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency and the features of the dermoscopic island (DI) in melanocytic lesions and to assess its specificity for the diagnosis of melanoma. Dermoscopy improves the diagnostic accuracy of melanoma, but only a few dermoscopic descriptors specific for thin melanomas have been identified. We defined a new descriptor, the dermoscopic island, a well-circumscribed area showing a uniform dermoscopic pattern that differs from the rest of the pigmented lesion. DESIGN: Dermoscopic images of 96 in situ melanomas, 266 invasive melanomas, and 612 dermoscopic atypical nevi were evaluated to establish the presence and the main pattern of the DI. Also, clinical and histologic characteristics were analyzed. SETTING: Dermoscopic images were collected from lesions excised between 2003 and 2008 at the Department of Dermatology, University of Modena and Reggio Emilia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Specificity and odds ratio for melanoma; dermoscopic and histologic characteristics of lesions with a DI. RESULTS: The DI was present in 10.4% of in situ melanomas, 4.1% of invasive melanomas, and 3.1% of dermoscopic atypical nevi. The odds ratio for melanoma was 1.922, and specificity was 96.9%. Invasive melanomas with a DI were thinner than those lacking this descriptor. In addition, more than half of the melanomas with a DI arose on a nevus. The DI appeared mainly reticular on a reticular background. CONCLUSION: The DI is characteristic of thin melanoma arising in a nevus; thus, it can be considered a potential early sign of transformation of a nevus into a melanoma.",cancer"Environmental cues to UV radiation and personal sun protection in outdoor winter recreation. OBJECTIVE: To predict the prevalence of UV radiation (hereinafter, UV) at North American ski resorts using temporal, seasonal, altitudinal, and meteorological factors and associate UV with a set of adult sun protection behaviors. DESIGN: Ultraviolet radiation observations and cross-sectional survey of adults on sun protection were collected. SETTING: Data were collected at 32 high-altitude ski areas located in western North America from 2001 through 2003. PARTICIPANTS: The sample consisted of 3937 adult skiers or snowboarders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements of direct, reflected, and diffuse UV were performed at 487 measurement points using handheld meters and combined with self-reported and observed sun protection assessed for adults interviewed on chairlifts. RESULTS: The strongest predictors of UV were temporal proximity to noon, deviation from winter solstice, and clear skies. By contrast, altitude and latitude had more modest associations with UV and temperature had a small positive relationship with UV. Guest sun safety was inconsistently associated with UV: UV was positively related to adults wearing more sunscreen, reapplying it after 2 hours, and wearing protective eyewear, but fewer adults exhibited many of the other sun protection behaviors, such as wearing hats and protective clothing or using lip balm, on days when UV was elevated. Guests took more sun safety precautions on clear-sky days but took steps to maintain body warmth on inclement days. CONCLUSIONS: In future sun safety promotions, adults should be encouraged to wear sunscreen on cloudy days because UV is still high and conditions can change rapidly. They need reminders to rely more on season and time of day when judging UV and the need for sun safety.",cancer"Early white discoloration of infantile hemangioma: a sign of impending ulceration. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between early white discoloration of infantile hemangioma (IH) and ulceration. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: A case series of 11 infants with early white discoloration of IH are described. An additional 55 infants with IH, aged 3 months, were evaluated retrospectively from a photograph archive to further explore the relationship between early white discoloration and presence or development of ulceration. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient demographics and hemangioma size, location, and subtype are documented. Sensitivity and specificity of white discoloration in relationship to ulceration are estimated. RESULTS: Ten of the 11 infants in the case series were girls (90%); all IHs were of segmental or indeterminate subtype. Average age at first ulceration was 2.6 months, with average age at healing 5.2 months. No intervention halted progression of ulceration. Of the 55 additional 3-month-old infants, 14 had white discoloration and 12 of these 14 had or developed ulceration (86%). When the hemangioma was either white or slightly white, sensitivity for predicting ulceration was 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78-1.00), with a specificity of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.51-0.81). In contrast, in infants with either slightly white or no white discoloration, the sensitivity for not developing ulceration was 0.80 (95% CI, 0.52-0.96), with a specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.83-0.99), suggesting that a lack of substantial white discoloration early in infancy indicates low risk of ulceration. CONCLUSION: Early white discoloration of infantile hemangioma is highly suggestive of impending ulceration.",cancer"Uncertainty in the perioperative management of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma among Mohs surgeons. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether Mohs surgeons' management of high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (HRCSCC) is uniform regarding radiologic nodal staging (RNS) and adjuvant radiation therapy (ART). DESIGN: A survey study of randomly selected, fellowship-trained Mohs surgeons. SETTING: An academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: American College of Mohs Surgery members who responded to an e-mail invitation completed either a survey regarding management of HRCSCC (n=117) or SCC with perineural invasion (PNI) (n=118). Participants totaled approximately 25% of the American College of Mohs Surgery membership. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: (1) Percentage of patients with HRCSCC referred for RNS, sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB), or ART over the preceding 12 months; (2) top factors leading surgeons to consider RNS, SLNB, or ART; and (3) acceptance of ART for clinical scenarios of various degrees of PNI. RESULTS: Most respondents cited PNI and in-transit metastasis as top factors leading to consideration of RNS, SLNB, or ART. Otherwise, there was no consensus regarding use of, or indications for, RNS, SLNB, or ART. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of consistency between experts indicates that there is equipoise regarding indications for RNS and ART in HRCSCC. There is also wide variation in RNS and ART practices among Mohs surgeons who are specifically trained to manage HRCSCC. Clinical trials should therefore be conducted in these areas as there is no clear standard of care.",cancer"The essence of senescence. Almost half a century after the first reports describing the limited replicative potential of primary cells in culture, there is now overwhelming evidence for the existence of ""cellular senescence"" in vivo. It is being recognized as a critical feature of mammalian cells to suppress tumorigenesis, acting alongside cell death programs. Here, we review the various features of cellular senescence and discuss their contribution to tumor suppression. Additionally, we highlight the power and limitations of the biomarkers currently used to identify senescent cells in vitro and in vivo.",cancer"The value of 99mTc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT in predicting survival in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT has been reported as a useful tool for the evaluation of glioma proliferation. In the present study, we set out to investigate the prognostic value of (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. METHODS: We prospectively studied 18 patients (13 men, 5 women; mean age +/- SD, 60.8 +/- 7.79 y) who were operated on for glioblastoma multiforme. All patients underwent preoperative (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT, and surgical excision was performed within a week after SPECT. All patients received postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy. RESULTS: By calculating the lesion-to-normal (L/N) (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake ratio, we found that patients with an L/N ratio of more than 4.7 had significantly worse survival than did patients with an L/N ratio of 4.7 or less. Furthermore, patients with a Karnofsky Performance Score more than 90 had a significantly better survival rate. Although patients with near-total tumor resection who were younger than 60 y survived longer, the difference did not reach statistical significance. In the multivariate analysis, (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin uptake and Karnofsky Performance Score were identified as factors with independent prognostic power. CONCLUSION: (99m)Tc-tetrofosmin brain SPECT may be an independent prognostic factor in patients with glioblastoma multiforme. Further larger studies are needed to verify these results.",cancer"Early repeated 18F-FDG PET scans during neoadjuvant chemoradiation fail to predict histopathologic response or survival benefit in adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. This study evaluated the role of (18)F-FDG PET as an early predictor of histopathologic response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and overall survival in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus undergoing multimodal therapy. METHODS: Thirty-seven patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus underwent pretreatment and an intratreatment (18)F-FDG PET scan in the second week of a 6-wk regimen of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Histopathologic response and overall survival were correlated with percentage change in (18)F-FDG uptake (%Deltamaximum standardized uptake value [%DeltaSUVmax]). RESULTS: In 16 patients (43%), treatment induced a histopathologic response (<10% viable tumor cells), which was associated with a significant (P < 0.05) survival benefit. The optimal reduction in (18)F-FDG uptake, which separated histopathologic responders and nonresponders, was a -26.4% DeltaSUVmax (receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis). At this separation, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) were 62.5%, 71.4%, 62.5%, 71.4%, and 67.4%, respectively, for intratreatment (18)F-FDG PET scans. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of (18)F-FDG PET responders (>26.4% reduction in SUVmax), compared with (18)F-FDG PET nonresponders (<26.4% reduction in SUVmax), revealed no survival benefit for responders (P = 0.6812). CONCLUSION: The %DeltaSUVmax during the second week of induction chemoradiation did not correlate either with histopathologic response or with survival. Our results show that, in contrast to published reports on neoadjuvant chemotherapy, combined chemoradiotherapy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus lowers the predictive accuracy of early repeated (18)F-FDG PET in identifying histopathologic responders and those with chances for increased survival below clinically applicable levels.",cancer"Repeatability of metabolically active volume measurements with 18F-FDG and 18F-FLT PET in non-small cell lung cancer. In addition to tumor size measurements with CT, there is a need for quantitative measurements of metabolic active volumes, possibly adding to tracer uptake measurements in oncologic response evaluation with PET. The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic volume test-retest variability in (18)F-FDG and 3'-deoxy-3'-(18)F-fluorothymidine ((18)F-FLT) PET studies for various commonly used volumes of interest (VOIs) and the dependence of that variability on lesion size and relative radiotracer uptake. METHODS: Twenty non-small cell lung cancer patients were scanned twice with (18)F-FDG (n = 11) or (18)F-FLT (n = 9). VOIs were defined on images reconstructed with normalization- and attenuation-weighted ordered-subset expectation maximization using 4 isocontours (A41%, A50%, and A70% thresholds, adapted for local background, and 50% threshold, uncorrected for background). Statistical analysis comprised intraclass correlation coefficients and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS: In the (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT groups, 34 and 20 lesions, respectively, were analyzed. Median volumes at the A50% threshold were 3.31 and 2.19 mL (interquartile range, 1.91-8.90 and 1.52-7.27 mL) for (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients were greater than 0.9, with the exception of the A70%-based metabolic volumes for (18)F-FLT. For lesions greater than 4.2 mL, repeatability coefficients (RCs = 1.96 x SD) of the percentage difference ranged from 22% to 37% for (18)F-FDG and from 39% to 73% for (18)F-FLT, depending on the VOI method being used. Repeatability was better for larger tumors, but there was no dependence on absolute uptake (standardized uptake value). CONCLUSION: Results indicate that changes of greater than 37% for (18)F-FDG and greater than 73% for (18)F-FLT (1.96 x SD) for lesions with A50% metabolic volumes greater than 4.2 mL represent a biologic effect. For smaller lesions (A50% VOI < 4.2 mL), an absolute change of 1.0 and 0.9 mL for (18)F-FDG and (18)F-FLT, respectively, is biologically relevant. Considering the balance between the success rate of automatic tumor delineation and repeatability of metabolic volume, a 50% threshold with correction for local background activity (A50%) seems optimal among the VOI methods evaluated.",cancerMolecular mechanisms of bone 18F-NaF deposition. There is renewed interest in (18)F-NaF bone imaging with PET or PET/CT. The current brief discussion focuses on the molecular mechanisms of (18)F-NaF deposition in bone and presents model-based approaches to quantifying bone perfusion and metabolism in the context of preclinical and clinical applications of bone imaging with PET.,cancer"Improvement of early 18F-FDG PET interpretation in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: importance of the reference background. This study investigated whether the reference background above which a residual mass is considered positive in the International Harmonization Project criteria should be modified for early (18)F-FDG PET evaluation. METHODS: In 92 patients with newly diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the maximal standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was measured on post-cycle 2 PET in the most intense residual mass (or, in the case of negative PET findings, in the area of most intense tumor uptake before therapy), in the mediastinal blood pool (MBP) and the liver, as potential reference background tissues. RESULTS: With MBP as a reference (SUVmax, 2.0 +/- 0.6), PET was unable to distinguish early responders from nonresponders. In contrast, with liver as a reference (SUVmax, 2.5 +/- 0.7), 2-y progression-free survival was significantly different between patients with PET-negative findings (81.8% [95% confidence interval, 71%-93%]) and patients with PET-positive findings (51.8% [95% confidence interval, 35%-69%], P = 0.003). CONCLUSION: When assessing early response, particularly in risk-adapted therapeutic trials, it seems preferable to refer to a background tissue (liver) with a higher level of uptake than that of current international criteria (MBP) which were designed for end-of-treatment evaluation.",cancer"18F-FDG PET/CT for the prediction and detection of local recurrence after radiofrequency ablation of malignant lung lesions. The utility of (18)F-FDG PET/CT for response assessment in malignant lung tumors treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and for the detection and prediction of local recurrence was investigated. METHODS: Between December 17, 2003, and April 9, 2008, 68 consecutive patients (mean age, 68 y) with 94 pulmonary lesions, including metastases (n = 38) and primary lung cancers (n = 44), underwent RFA. Because of inadequate imaging follow-up in 12 patients, only 82 lesions were analyzed (CT scans, n = 82; (18)F-FDG PET/CT scans, n = 62). The median follow-up was 25 mo (range, 12-66 mo). A baseline study was defined as (18)F-FDG PET/CT performed no more than 3 mo before RFA. The first postablation scan was defined as PET/CT performed between 1 and 4 mo after RFA; additional follow-up studies were obtained in some cases between 6 and 12 mo after RFA. The unidimensional maximum diameter of the lesion was recorded on a pretherapy diagnostic CT scan or on the CT component of a pretherapy (18)F-FDG PET/CT scan, whichever was obtained most recently, using lung windows. Maximum standardized uptake values (SUVs) were recorded for all lesions imaged by (18)F-FDG PET/CT. (18)F-FDG uptake patterns on post-RFA scans were classified as favorable or unfavorable. Survival and recurrence probabilities were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Uni- and multivariate analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Before RFA, factors predicting greater local recurrence-free survival included initial lesion size less than 3 cm (P = 0.01) and SUV less than 8 (P = 0.02), although the latter was not an independent predictor in multivariate analysis. Treated metastases recurred less often than treated primary lung cancers (P = 0.03). Important post-RFA factors that related to reduced recurrence-free survival included an unfavorable uptake pattern (P < 0.01), post-RFA SUV (P < 0.01), and an increase in SUV over time after ablation (P = 0.05). CONCLUSION: (18)F-FDG PET/CT parameters on both preablation and postablation scans may predict local recurrence in patients treated with RFA for lung metastases and primary lung cancers.",cancer"Culture of omentum-induced regenerating liver yielded hepatocyte-committed stem cells. Earlier we showed that when omentum, activated by inert particles, is allowed to fuse to a wedge cut in the liver, it induces stem cell proliferation in the liver resulting in massive liver regeneration. Here, we attempt to culture stem cells from the omentum-induced regenerating liver tissue. Cells from regenerating liver tissue were harvested and cultured. Cultured cells were characterized by immune staining, fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis, growth factor assay, in vitro differentiation, and their ability to engraft to injured sites in vivo. Culture yielded cells with a mesenchymal stem cell phenotype that could be maintained in culture indefinitely. These cells, called regenerating liver stem cells, expressed both adult and embryonic stem cell markers, secreted high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor, and expressed albumin. When grown on matrigel in the presence of hepatocyte growth factor, these cells differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells in culture, but they did not differentiate to adipogenic and osteogenic lineages when grown in specific differentiation medium. The differentiated cells expressed alpha-fetoprotein and secreted high levels of albumin and urea. After systemic injection, the undifferentiated cells engrafted only to the injured sites in the liver and not to the normal areas of the liver. In conclusion, omentum-induced regenerating liver yields hepatocyte-committed stem cells in culture. Such cells could prove to be useful in cell transplantation therapies.",cancer"Higher levels of GATA3 predict better survival in women with breast cancer. The GATA family members are zinc finger transcription factors involved in cell differentiation and proliferation. GATA3 in particular is necessary for mammary gland maturation, and its loss has been implicated in breast cancer development. Our goal was to validate the ability of GATA3 expression to predict survival in breast cancer patients. Protein expression of GATA3 was analyzed on a high-density tissue microarray consisting of 242 cases of breast cancer. We associated GATA3 expression with patient outcomes and clinicopathologic variables. Expression of GATA3 was significantly increased in breast cancer, in situ lesions, and hyperplastic tissue compared with normal breast tissue. GATA3 expression decreased with increasing tumor grade. Low GATA3 expression was a significant predictor of disease-related death in all patients, as well as in subgroups of estrogen receptor-positive or low-grade patients. In addition, low GATA3 expression correlated with increased tumor size and estrogen and progesterone receptor negativity. GATA3 is an important predictor of disease outcome in breast cancer patients. This finding has been validated in a diverse set of populations. Thus, GATA3 expression has utility as a prognostic indicator in breast cancer.",cancer"Expression of master regulatory genes controlling skeletal development in benign cartilage and bone forming tumors. Recent progress in skeletal molecular biology has led to the clarification of the transcriptional mechanisms of chondroblastic and osteoblastic lineage differentiation. Three master transcription factors-Sox9, Runx2, and Osterix-were shown to play an essential role in determining the skeletal progenitor cells' fate. The present study evaluates the expression of these factors in 4 types of benign bone tumors-chondromyxoid fibroma, chondroblastoma, osteoid osteoma, and osteoblastoma-using immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays. Osteoid osteoma and osteoblastoma showed strong nuclear expression of Osterix and Runx2. In contrast, only a few chondroblastomas showed positive nuclear expression of Osterix. Strong nuclear expression of Sox9 was detected in all chondroblastomas, whereas nearly half of the osteoblastomas showed focal weak cytoplasmic expression of Sox9.",cancer"The epidermal growth factor receptor pathway in relation to pelvic lymph node metastasis and survival in early-stage cervical cancer. The objective of this study is to correlate the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) components with clinical behavior of early-stage cervical cancer. Tissue samples of 336 consecutive Federation of International Gynecologists and Obstetricians stage IB-IIA cervical cancer patients all treated primarily by radical surgery were collected. Clinicopathologic and follow-up data were prospectively obtained during standard treatment and follow-up. As representatives for the EGFR pathway, expression of EGFR, pEGFR, PTEN, pAKT, and pERK was assessed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. Positive immunostaining was observed for EGFR in 32.1%, for pEGFR in 21.0%, for PTEN in 38.3%, for pAKT in 5.3%, and for pERK in 4.3% of tumor samples. Positive EGFR immunostaining was associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (odds ratio [OR], 7.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.38-16.23, P < .001), negative pEGFR immunostaining with poor differentiation (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.20-0.73, P = .004), and negative PTEN immunostaining with metastatic pelvic lymph nodes (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.30-0.90, P = .019). In multivariate analysis, only pelvic lymph node metastasis (hazard ratio, 6.11; 95% CI, 3.46-10.77, P < .001) and poor differentiation (hazard ratio, 1.91; 95% CI, 1.12-3.26, P = .018) were related to disease-specific survival. In early-stage cervical cancer, loss of PTEN expression is associated with pelvic lymph node metastasis, suggesting PTEN to be one of the tumor suppressor genes affecting pelvic lymph node metastasis. However, expression of EGFR pathway components does not appear to have prognostic impact in surgically treated early-stage cervical cancer.",cancer"Significant association between polymorphism of the erythropoietin gene promoter and myelodysplastic syndrome. BACKGROUND: Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) may be induced by certain mutagenic environmental or chemotherapeutic toxins; however, the role of susceptibility genes remains unclear. The G/G genotype of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1617640 in the erythropoietin (EPO) promoter has been shown to be associated with decreased EPO expression. We examined the association of rs1617640 genotype with MDS. METHODS: We genotyped the EPO rS1617640 SNP in 189 patients with MDS, 257 with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), 106 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 97 with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, 353 with chronic myeloid leukemia, and 95 healthy controls. RESULTS: The G/G genotype was significantly more common in MDS patients (47/187; 25.1%) than in controls (6/95; 6.3%) or in patients with other leukemias (101/813; 12.4%) (all P < 0.001). Individuals with the G/G genotype were more likely than those with other genotypes to have MDS (odd ratio = 4.98; 95% CI = 2.04-12.13). Clinical and follow up data were available for 112 MDS patients and 186 AML patients. There was no correlation between EPO promoter genotype and response to therapy or overall survival in MDS or AML. In the MDS group, the GG genotype was significantly associated with shorter complete remission duration, as compared with the TT genotype (P = 0.03). Time to neutrophils recovery after therapy was significantly longer in MDS patients with the G/G genotype (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a strong association between the rs1617640 G/G genotype and MDS. Further studies are warranted to investigate the utility of screening for this marker in individuals exposed to environmental toxins or chemotherapy.",cancer"Therapeutic molecular targets in human chondrosarcoma. Chondrosarcomas are malignant cartilage tumours. They are poorly responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Treatment is usually limited to surgical resection; however, survival of patients with high-grade chondrosarcoma is poor, even with wide surgical resection. Induction of apoptosis in chondrosarcoma cells, either directly or by enhancement of the response to chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation, may be a route by which outcome can be improved. In this article, we review potential molecular targets that regulate chondrocyte apoptosis and discuss the experimental evidence for their utility.",cancer"Obtusilactone A and (-)-sesamin induce apoptosis in human lung cancer cells by inhibiting mitochondrial Lon protease and activating DNA damage checkpoints. Several compounds from Cinnamomum kotoense show anticancer activities. However, the detailed mechanisms of most compounds from C. kotoense remain unknown. In this study, we investigated the anticancer activity of obtusilactone A (OA) and (-)-sesamin in lung cancer. Our results show that human Lon is upregulated in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, and downregulation of Lon triggers caspase-3 mediated apoptosis. Through enzyme-based screening, we identified two small-molecule compounds, obtusilactone A (OA) and (-)-sesamin from C. kotoense, as potent Lon protease inhibitors. Obtusilactone A and (-)-sesamin interact with Ser855 and Lys898 residues in the active site of the Lon protease according to molecular docking analysis. Thus, we suggest that cancer cytotoxicity of the compounds is partly due to the inhibitory effects on Lon protease. In addition, the compounds are able to cause DNA double-strand breaks and activate checkpoints. Treatment with OA and (-)-sesamin induced p53-independent DNA damage responses in NSCLC cells, including G(1) /S checkpoint activation and apoptosis, as evidenced by phosphorylation of checkpoint proteins (H2AX, Nbs1, and Chk2), caspase-3 cleavage, and sub-G(1) accumulation. In conclusion, OA and (-)-sesamin act as both inhibitors of human mitochondrial Lon protease and DNA damage agents to activate the DNA damage checkpoints as well induce apoptosis in NSCLC cells. These dual functions open a bright avenue to develop more selective chemotherapy agents to overcome chemoresistance and sensitize cancer cells to other chemotherapeutics.",cancer"Phase I/II study of a 3-week cycle of irinotecan and S-1 in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. The combination of an oral fluoropyrimidine derivative, S-1, and irinotecan is expected to be a promising regimen for advanced colorectal cancer. This study was performed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) of irinotecan combined with S-1 in a 3-week cycle regimen and to observe the safety and efficacy for patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer. Eighty milligrams per m(2) of S-1 was given orally for 14 consecutive days and escalated doses of irinotecan were administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks in the phase I trial. Forty patients were treated at the RD during the phase II trial. Forty-three patients were enrolled between February 2005 and March 2007. The dose-limiting toxicity was diarrhea and abdominal pain. The MTD of irinotecan was 100 mg/m(2) and the RD was determined to be 80 mg/m(2) of irinotecan combined with 80 mg/m(2) of S-1. The phase II trial showed that 22 of 40 patients achieved a complete or partial response and eight had stable disease. The overall response rate was 55.0%. The median progression-free survival time and median survival time were 6.7 and 21 months, respectively. There were no treatment-related deaths. The main toxicities were leukopenia, neutropenia, anorexia and diarrhea. This study suggests the combination of irinotecan and S-1 repeated every 3 weeks is tolerable and effective for patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer.",cancer"Cancer incidence and mortality in Indigenous Australians in Queensland, 1997-2006. OBJECTIVE: To examine cancer incidence and mortality in Indigenous Queenslanders. DESIGN, SETTING AND PATIENTS: Assessment of indirectly standardised incidence and mortality ratios for Indigenous Australians in Queensland diagnosed with cancer from 1997 to 2006, compared with the total Queensland population. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardised incidence and mortality ratios. RESULTS: Compared with the total Queensland population, Indigenous Queenslanders had a lower overall incidence of cancer (standardised incidence ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.75-0.82), but a higher incidence of some of the more fatal cancer types. Overall cancer mortality was higher (standardised mortality ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.28-1.45) and similar to rates for Indigenous people in other Australian states. CONCLUSION: Cancer rates for Indigenous Queenslanders, a mostly urbanised population, are similar to rates for Indigenous Australians mostly living in remote areas.",cancer"Twenty-five years of treatment for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia in Western Australia: how do we compare? OBJECTIVES: To compare survival among the subgroup of children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) who were treated at Princess Margaret Hospital for Children (PMH) in Perth, Western Australia, over 25 years under 15 consecutive protocols of the Children's Cancer Group (CCG) with survival for the entire cohort of children in multiple centres treated under CCG protocols in that period; and to highlight the benefits of membership of a large cooperative research group conducting multicentre randomised controlled trials. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Retrospective review of the outcomes of all 311 children with newly diagnosed ALL treated at PMH between 1983 and 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 4-year event-free survival; and 10-year overall survival. RESULTS: Four-year event-free survival for the entire PMH cohort increased from 66% (SE, 6%) for 1983-1987 to 88% (SE, 6%) for 2002-2005, while overall survival over the same period improved from 78% (SE, 5%) to 94% (SE, 4%). Comparisons of outcomes of children treated at PMH with those of the entire CCG cohort, protocol by protocol, revealed similar outcomes. CONCLUSION: Outcomes of children treated at PMH over the 25-year period are equivalent to those of the larger CCG cohort.",cancer"Symptoms, investigations and management of patients with cancer of the oesophagus and gastro-oesophageal junction in Australia. OBJECTIVE: To document presenting symptoms, investigations and management for Australian patients with oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC), gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma (GOJAC) and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional study of a population-based sample of 1100 Australian patients aged 18-79 years with histologically confirmed oesophageal cancer diagnosed in 2002-2005, using data from cancer registries and treatment centres, supplemented with clinical information collected through medical record review in 2006-2007 and mortality information collected in 2008. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of primary symptoms, and staging investigations and treatment modalities used. RESULTS: The primary presenting symptom was dysphagia, which was self-reported by 41%, 39% and 48% of patients with OAC, GOJAC and OSCC, respectively. Less common symptoms were reflux, chest pain, bleeding and weight loss. All patients underwent endoscopy, most had a staging computed tomography scan (OAC 93%, GOJAC 95% and OSCC 93%), and about half had positron emission tomography scans (OAC 51%, GOJAC 44% and OSCC 42%). Pretreatment tumour stage was reported in 25% of records, and could be derived from results of investigations in a further 23%, but the remaining half lacked sufficient information to ascribe a pretreatment stage. Curative treatments were attempted for 60% of OAC, 88% of GOJAC and 65% of OSCC patients. Surgery was performed on 52% of OAC, 83% of GOJAC and 41% of OSCC patients. About two-thirds of surgical patients received additional therapies. CONCLUSIONS: With anticipated increases in oesophageal cancer incidence, the resources required to diagnose and manage patients with oesphageal cancer are also likely to rise. Our data provide a baseline from which to plan for the future care of patients with cancers of the oesophagus.",cancer"Obesity and microvascular invasion in hepatocellular carcinoma. BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients with higher Body Mass Index (BMI) might have more microvascular invasion (MVI) in their tumors. METHODS: Records from 138 consecutive patients who underwent surgery at Columbia University Medical Center from January 1, 2002 to January 9, 2008 were evaluated. RESULTS: 40 patients (29%) had MVI, including 14% with BMI <25, 31% with BMI = 25-30, and 40% with BMI >30 (p = .05). However, only maximum alpha-fetoprotein was significantly associated with overall mortality in a Cox model. CONCLUSIONS: MVI was associated with obesity. A better understanding of the mechanism of this association may lead to interventions for the treatment and prevention of HCC.",cancerHuge endometriosis presenting like an ovarian tumor: CT appearance. A 32-year-old female with a clinical history of abdominal swelling underwent CT of the abdomen. A huge biloculated cystic mass with a mural nodule in the abdominal and pelvic region was seen. The lesion showed slightly homogeneous enhancement. The imaging findings suggested an ovarian tumor. Histopathological evaluation after surgical resection revealed that the lesion was a bilateral ovarian endometriosis.,cancer"Ovarian torsion; early diagnosis by MRI to prevent irreversible damage. BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of ovarian torsion can help prevent irreversible damage to the adnexal structures in women desiring to maintain fertility. CASE: The patient was transferred by ambulance for a six-hour history of severe lower abdominal pain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral enlarged ovaries measuring 5 x 6 cm (right) and 4 x 5 cm (left) with a right twisted and thickened peduncle. Ultrasonography failed to detect the peduncle changes. At surgery, the right adnexa was twisted 180 degrees in a clockwise direction with no findings suggestive of gangrenous change, hemorrhagic infarction or ischemic change. Detorsion of the twisted ovary was performed. CONCLUSION: Detection of tube torsion at MRI may be useful in the preoperative evaluation for surgical detorsion of twisted adnexa encountered in enlarged ovaries.",cancer"Pregnancy and adnexal torsion: analysis of 20 cases. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical profile, management and outcome of pregnancy complicated by adnexal torsion. METHODS: All pregnancy cases complicated by adnexal torsion admitted between January 2001 and January 2009 were analyzed. RESULTS: The total number of pregnant cases was 20. Age range of pregnant women with adnexal torsion was 18 to 42 years. Of these cases 70% were seen in the first and second trimester. Seventy percent of cases were operated by the laparotomy route and 30% by laparoscopy. Salpingo-oophorectomy was performed in 70% of cases and detorsion in 30% of cases. Histopathologic examinations revealed five patients (25%) had serous cystadenoma, four patients (20%) mucinous cystadenoma, six patients (20%) dermoid cyst and five patients (25%) hemorrhagic cyst. CONLUSIONS: Adnexal torsion as a differential diagnosis of acute abdomen in pregnancy should be considered and we recommend early surgical treatment that will save the adnexa.",cancer"Is insulin-dependent diabetes and obesity a predisposition for endometrial and pancreatic carcinoma? Among 178 patients operated for endometrial carcinoma during a five-year period, 17 were re-operated at the Institute of Surgery (9.5%) because of pancreatic head carcinoma. The frequency of insulin-dependent diabetes was pointed out in patients-- 28% of those who were first diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma. Moreover in the same group diagnosed with endometrial carcinoma, we found 17 to have pancreatic carcinoma, and among those there were 12 cases that had diabetes (70.58%).",cancer"Serum retinol-binding protein-4 levels in polycystic ovary syndrome patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for in-vitro fertilization cycle. AIMS: To determine serum retinol-binding rotein 4 (RBP-4) levels in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients undergoing controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) for an in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) cycle and the possible correlation to COH variables. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 11 consecutive PCOS patients undergoing our routine IVF flexible multidose gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-antagonist protocol. Blood was drawn three times during the COH cycle: (1) day 1 or 2 of menstruation, and prior to gonadotropin administration (Day-S) (Day-S); (2) day of or prior to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) administration (Day-hCG); and (3) day of ovum pick-up (Day-OPU). Levels of estradiol and serum RBP-4 were compared among the three time points. Serum RBP-4 was measured with a commercial immunoassay. RESULTS: Results showed significantly lower levels of serum RBP-4 on Day-OPU and Day-hCG than on Day-S. Though significant correlations were observed between serum RBP-4 and body mass index, fasting glucose or glucose to insulin ratio, no correlations were found between serum RBP-4 and IVF treatment variables or pregnancy rate. CONCLUSION: While serum RBP-4 decreases during COH for IVF, there is apparently no correlation of serum RBP-4 levels with IVF treatment variables or outcome.",cancer"Groin recurrence following stage IA squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva with negative nodes on superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy. PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: Stage IA vulvar cancer with a depth of stromal invasion less than 1 mm is generally managed by wide local excision alone since there is less than 1% risk of lymph node involvement. CASE: A 62-year-old patient was admitted to a university hospital with a suspicious vulvar lesion. RESULTS: We present the first case of inguinal node and a possible contralateral pubic ramus recurrence following bilateral superficial inguinal lymphadenectomy and wide local resection for Stage 1A vulvar cancer. CONCLUSION: There is no evidence that extended radical surgery provides a better overall survival or reduces recurrence rate in Stage 1A vulvar carcinomas. Conservative vulvar resection and sentinel node dissection seem to be a rational choice. Nevertheless the disease may recur in the inguinal areas and frequently be lethal, therefore close surveillance and early attempts to treat the recurrent disease before infection and inflammation ensues should be the aim of current treatment strategies.",cancer"Chemotherapy with low-dose bevacizumab and carboplatin in the treatment of a patient with recurrent cervical cancer. Management of patients with recurrent or advanced cervical cancer is a challenge. Concurrent chemotherapy has become the mainstay of treatment and platinum remains the most effective single agent. Combinations of other agents have not demonstrated significant advantages. The application of angiogenesis inhibitors such as bevacizumab, an antibody inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor, in metastatic or advanced cervical cancer remains to be evaluated. We present the case of a patient with platinum-resistant recurrent cervical cancer treated with low-dose bevacizumab and carboplatin, with resultant improved disease progression and tolerable toxicity profiles.",cancer"Serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma incidentally discovered in a 29-year-old patient: case report. This is a review of a case of Stage I A serous ovarian cystadenocarcinoma in a 29-year-old patient. The patient had no symptoms of illness. She underwent a surgical intervention because of cysts in both of her ovaries. By histopathological examination of the tissue sample taken during the surgical intervention, it was discovered that the patient suffered from a serous cystadenocarcinoma in her left ovary. Five years after the surgical intervention there have been no symptoms of relapse.",cancer"Ovarian carcinomatosis presenting as bilateral inguinal hernia: a brief report. The differential diagnosis for what may seem an inguinal hernia may be complex, as lateral pain may be of many types of origin. We report the case of a 48-year-old female patient who presented with a history of painful, progressively protruding soft bulging masses over the bilateral inguinal area and a 20-year history of head cancer and hepatitis B virus. Pathological analysis, gynecological ultrasound and abdominal computed tomography scan were required to make final determination. Final diagnosis was Stage IV ovarian carcinomatosis, which responded to chemotherapy. Initial diagnosis of inguinal hernia should not rule out other potential diagnoses, particularly in complex cases with other risk factors.",cancer"Liver resection for metastases arising from recurrent granulosa cell tumour of the ovary--a case series. Ovarian granulosa cell tumours (GCT) occur rarely and represent 2-3% of all ovarian tumours. Regarded as tumours with low malignant potential and renowned for late recurrences, these tumours occasionally metastasize to the liver. We present our experience with three patients who underwent secondary cytoreductive surgery including liver resection for recurrence of the disease resulting in greatly improved quality of life and disease-free interval.",cancer"Ovarian metastasis of a primary renal cell carcinoma: case report and review of literature. Ovarian metastases from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are very rare, with only 23 cases reported in the literature. We report a case of 54-year-old women who developed bilateral ovarian metastasis 39 months after diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was carried out. Subsequently she was treated with sunitinib and her disease stabilized. She is still alive four years after diagnosis of the renal primary, and disease has stabilized on sunitinib. We conclude that, although rare, the possibility of metastatic RCC should be considered in the differential diagnosis of clear cell tumors of the ovary. Due to therapeutic and prognostic implications, it is very important to differentiate if the tumor is a primary ovarian tumor or a metastasis from a renal cell carcinoma. Early diagnosis of this rare metastatic tumor results in prompt treatment and prolonged patient survival.",cancerThree-dimensional power Doppler color ultrasonographic features of a minimal deviation adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix. A case of minimal deviation adenocarcinoma of the cervix in a 34-year-old female is presented. The ultrasonographic and three-dimensional power Doppler color studies revealed a nodular cervical lesion with vascularization more prominent in the center of the nodule but also present at the periphery. The imaging diagnosis was suggestive of a myoma but with more vascularization than a conventional one.,cancer"Metastatic and recurrent adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix: a long-term survival of 16 years. PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATION: Recurrent metastatic adenocarcinoma of the cervix is associated with an extremely poor prognosis. Treatment options for recurrent disease are limited and cure is extremely rare. CASE REPORT: We report a case of a 43-year-old patient with Stage IB adenocarcinoma of the cervix. She had multiple metastatic recurrence episodes salvaged with several radical surgeries, external and intraoperative irradiation, and chemotherapy over a survival period of 16 years. CONCLUSION: We conclude that long-term multi-modal salvage treatment may achieve longer survival in rare cases with recurrent metastatic adenocarcinoma of the cervix.",cancer"A benign metastasizing leiomyoma involving a nodule in the pulmonary artery: case and literature review. Benign metastasizing leiomyoma (BML) is a rare disease defined as a primary benign uterine tumor with ""metastatic"" lesions preferentially occurring in the lung, pelvis and lymph nodes. There are few reports about local recurrence after initial surgery. We report a case of a BML with local recurrence and metastasis growing into the wall of the left pulmonary artery, diagnosed 11 years after initial hysterectomy. A 55-year-old woman complaining of abdominal discomfort, heaviness and asthenia was admitted to our hospital for investigation of a voluminous uterine mass with high vascularization and three pulmonary nodules. The resection of the mass by laparotomy was complicated by uncontrolled severe hemorrhage due to vascular proliferation, requiring multiple transfusions, packing the cavity and postoperative uterine artery embolization. Three months later the patient underwent a left upper lobe lobectomy with the aim of removing the largest pulmonary nodule, a nodule a located in the lingular branch of the left pulmonary artery. The comparison of hysterectomy and lobectomy pieces showed a similar aspect, leading thus to the diagnosis of BML. Awareness of this rare entity should potentially avoid under-diagnosis and difficulties due to hemorrhage during surgery.",cancer"Evaluation of preoperative diagnosis with results of histopathological examinations of ovarian tumors in women of reproductive age. Ovarian tumors are the most frequent lesions encountered by gynecologists. Ovarian carcinoma most often develops asymptomatically and until now no sufficient screening diagnostic methods have been developed, which is why various diagnostic methods are being tried concurrently to increase diagnostic sensitivity. The aim of this paper was to evaluate the compliance of the preoperative diagnoses with the results of histopathological examinations of ovarian tumors and to determine the usefulness of simultaneous application of gynecological, ultrasonographic, and Doppler examinations together with determination of CA-125 antigen in the diagnostic process of ovarian tumors. The study comprised a group of 250 women in reproductive age who were operated on for tumors of the ovary. Results of histopathological examinations were compared with the preoperative diagnosis based on the above-mentioned examinations and prognostic indicators: sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive prediction value as well as accuracy were determined. The results showed that combining the four diagnostic methods is a useful research panel in the preoperative diagnostic process of ovarian tumors and makes selecting the appropriate procedure and surgical treatment viable.",cancer"Intestinal-type metaplasia in the original squamous epithelium of the cervix. There have been a number of reports on cervical carcinomas, both invasive and intraepithelial (CIN III), indicating the presence of intracellular mucins in the absence of glandular differentiation. Yet, the expression of such cells in the normal/original squamous epithelium of the cervix remains unexplored. We investigated the presence of mucin-distended goblet cells at this site, after examining retrospectively normal cervices from 250 hysterectomy specimens. Goblet cells were detected in 3.2% (8/250) of the cervices examined using haematoxylin and eosin stained sections and confirmed by mucin histochemistry: alcian blue (AB) pH 2.5, periodic acid-Schiff reaction with and without diastase digestion (PAS-d, PAS) and the combined AB/PAS. Additional sections were stained with Diazo and Masson-Fontana for argentaffin granules and Grimelius for argyrophil cells, but were all negative and no other cell types were identified. It is believed that this incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia is an acquired change in the cervix, derived from multi-potential stem cells of Mullerian duct origin.",cancer"Distribution of HPV genotypes in uterine cervical lesions among the Uighur women in Xinjiang province of China. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the distribution of HPV genotypes in uterine cervical lesions of Uighur women in the Xinjiang province of China. METHODS: A total of 223 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cervical tissue specimens from Uighur patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) were analyzed with HPV specific general primer pairs MY09/11 by PCR amplification and HPV chip. RESULTS: Among 223 cases, HPV-positive samples accounted for 58.7% (131/223). HPV infection rate increased along with the pathological grade of the specimens, with a clear tendency of normal < CIN 1 < CIN 2 < CIN 3 < SCC. HPV16 infection was the predominate one and reached the highest level in SCC with 96%. HPV18 and 58 were detected only in some specimens as a second infection in addition to HPV16. The infection rate and type of HPV was not closely associated with the histological differentiation of the cervical cancer. CONCLUSION: HPV 16 was the most common type detected in Uighur women with SCC and CIN in the Xinjiang area of China. Together with the high infection rate, this may be the reason for the four-fold higher cervical cancer incidence in this province and in this population, when compared to total China. The prevalence of HPV18 and 58 was relatively low.",cancer"Expression of p16 in serous ovarian neoplasms. PURPOSE: We aimed to examine p16 protein expression in ovarian serous neoplasms along with normal ovarian tissues. MATERIALS AND METHODS: P16 expression was immunhistochemically evaluated in 86 ovarian serous neoplasms (21 cystadenomas, 20 borderline tumors and 45 carcinomas) and 21 non-neoplastic ovarian tissue. The results were also compared with histopathological grade in serous adenocarcinomas. RESULTS: P16 expression rates for benign, borderline ovarian tumors and ovarian cancer were 14.2%, 85% and 86.6%, respectively. It was significantly higher in carcinomas (p < 0.001) and borderline tumors (p < 0.001) compared to cystadenomas. No immunoreactivity was found in the non-neoplastic ovarian surface epithelial cells. The percentage of p16 expression did not change significantly with histological grade in carcinomas. CONCLUSION: P16 expression is strong and widespread involving most tumor cells in serous papillary ovarian carcinomas, and is probably an early event.",cancer"Bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin for advanced ovarian cancer: low risk of gastrointestinal and cardiovascular toxicity. The purpose of this preliminary study was to retrospectively assess the incidence of bowel perforation and hypertension in two separate advanced ovarian cancer patient populations following first-line therapy, comprising paclitaxel, carboplatin and bevacizumab. The first 20 patients were treated with six cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2), carboplatin (AUC of 5 i.v.), and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg of body weight); q21 days per an independent protocol. The subsequent patients (n = 12) were administered weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m2), carboplatin (AUC of 5 i.v.) every four weeks, and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg of body weight) every two weeks for six cycles according to a separate, independent protocol. Bevacizumab was not added to either chemotherapy regimen until cycle 2. In both groups patients who achieved a complete response, partial response or stable disease at the conclusion of induction therapy received bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) and paclitaxel (135 mg/m2) q21 days as maintenance therapy. A total of 170 cycles (median = 6; range 3-6) of primary induction chemotherapy, 140 of which contained bevacizumab, were administered. Moreover, 206 cycles (median = 9; range 1-12) of maintenance chemotherapy have been delivered to 28 patients thus far. There was no incidence of GI perforation and only two patients demonstrated clinically significant hypertension. Previous studies involving bevacizumab have raised concerns regarding bowel perforations and hypertension. However, we did not encounter difficulties with either of these complications. While we recognize that the risk for bowel perforation remains in the 5-11% range, the study's preliminary results suggest that first-line treatment of advanced stage ovarian carcinoma with bevacizumab can be safely administered.",cancer"Analysis of clinical and molecular associations of triple negative breast cancers in node-negative patients. INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic modalities in node-negative breast cancer patients remain a matter of controversy. Various prognostic factors have been proposed to help select those patients that would most likely benefit from adjuvant therapy. In view of this notion the triple negative phenotype (hormone receptors and HER2 negative tumors) has gained increasing attention. AIM: To evaluate the clinicopathologic characteristics of triple negative (TN) tumors in node-negative invasive breast carcinomas. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the archival pathology tissues of 160 patients with node-negative invasive carcinomas, diagnosed and treated in two surgical departments in Greece from 1999 to 2006. Statistical analysis was used to examine the association between TN tumors and other clinicopathological factors. RESULTS: Triple negative breast cancers correlated with higher histologic grade, mitotic activation index and Ki-67 expression (p < 0.05). Moreover TN tumors were correlated with negative staining for bcl-2 (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: In node-negative breast cancer patients, triple negativity is associated with aggressive biologic behavior. Further studies are required to better understand the clinical implications of these findings.",cancer"Non-hormonal treatment of vasomotor symptoms in gynecological cancer patients. Gynaecological cancer patients generally suffer from an earlier and more severe menopausal syndrome than the general female population. Hormone replacement therapy is often contraindicated and there are non-hormonal treatments that are proven to be more effective than placebo in randomized controlled trials, e.g., some antidepressants, gabapentine and clonidine. The main limits to the use of these drugs in controlling hot flashes are the off-label use for this purpose, the very short follow-up and the fact that data come from studies performed on breast cancer, not on gynecological cancer patients. Patients believe that drugs derived from plants could be effective in relieving hot flashes and that they are harmless. Evidence is contrary to this belief and estrogen-sensitive cancer patients should be warned of the potential, though very weak, estrogenic effect of phytoestrogens and other ""natural"" drugs, and that their efficacy is close to that of a placebo.",cancer"Repeated chemosensitivity testing in patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma. Epithelial ovarian carcinoma (EOC) is a highly chemosensitive tumor, but most patients with advanced EOC initially responding to first-line chemotherapy will eventually relapse. Chemosensitivity testing may offer an opportunity for the optimal selection of chemotherapeutic agents for individual patients. In the present retrospective analysis we have examined the changes in chemosensitivity profiles during the course of the disease. Chemosensitivity was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) test. Two or more samples at least 14 days apart were obtained from 34 patients with ovarian cancer. Chemoresistance increased significantly at the second measurement only for paclitaxel and carboplatin, the most frequently used cytotoxic drugs. No significant difference compared to baseline was observed at subsequent measurements for any other cytotoxic agent studied, although a non-significant trend for increased chemoresistance was observed. In conclusion, in the present cohort only paclitaxel and carboplatin chemosensitivity changed significantly, although to a limited extent, during the course of the disease. In contrast to a limited increase of paclitaxel and carboplatin chemoresistance, no significant changes were observed for other cytotoxic agents examined. The present data indicate that chemoresistance increases, to a modest extent, against the drug most frequently used, but remains relatively stable during the course of disease, especially for agents that are not used in the therapeutic regimen.",cancer"Increase of Mcm3 and Mcm4 expression in cervical squamous cell carcinomas. PURPOSE: To examine the relevance of expression of two proteins essential for DNA replication initiation, Mcm3 and Mcm4, in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). METHODS: 53 cases of cervical squamous cell carcinoma, 35 cervical intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN) grade 2-3, 11 CIN I and 26 normal controls were studied. Immunohistochemistry was performed with anti-Mcm3 and anti-Mcm4 antibodies. RESULTS: We found Mcm3 and Mcm4 protein expression had a tendency to be stronger from control to CSCC. Both Mcm3 and Mcm4 were significantly upregulated in squamous cervical carcinoma compared to the control, CIN grade 1 and grade 2-3 (p < 0.001), and Mcm3 expression was correlated with CSCC cell differentiation. However there were no independent prognosis correlations between Mcm3 and Mcm4 and clinicopathological parameters including age, stage, tumor size, invasive depth and lymph node metastasis. CONCLUSIONS: Mcm3 and Mcm4 were highly expressed in CSCC, and these two proteins might be useful as biomolecular markers in clinical diagnosis.",cancerLiquid based cytology improves the positive predictive value of glandular smears compared to conventional cytology. PURPOSE: To investigate whether the introduction of liquid-based cytology (LBC) in an urban setting decreases the diagnosis of glandular neoplasia (grade 6) and improves the positive predictive value (PPV) of cervical cytological screening. METHODS: A retrospective database review was conducted identifying women with cervical cytological abnormalities including glandular neoplasia (grade 6) before and after the introduction of LBC. RESULTS: Following the introduction of LBC the rate of glandular neoplasia (grade 6) referrals fell from 1.08% to 0.69% of all cervical cytological abnormalities. There was a significant reduction in 'abnormal' cytological samples subsequently found to be associated with no invasive or preinvasive disease but no decrease in the number showing preinvasive or invasive disease. A significant decrease in number of patients having a final diagnosis of normal/inflammatory or wart changes was seen in those patients referred during the LBC period (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: The introduction of LBC in an urban setting decreased cytological glandular neoplasia referrals but not at the expense of missing preinvasive and invasive cancers. It has also increased the PPV of cervical sampling to detect preinvasive and invasive cancer from 59.6% to 76.0%.,cancer"A comparison of outcome in patients with stage 1 clear cell and grade 3 endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with and without adjuvant therapy. OBJECTIVE: To determine the outcomes in patients with Stage I uterine clear cell carcinoma (UCCC) treated with and without adjuvant therapy, and to compare the outcomes in these patients to that of matched controls, patients with Stage I, grade 3, endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium (EC). METHODS: Patients with FIGO Stage I UCCC who underwent comprehensive surgical staging between January 1996 and January 2007 were identified. Cases (UCCC) were matched by age, stage, adjuvant therapy, and year of diagnosis to controls consisting of patients with grade 3 EC. Recurrence and survival were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: 25 patients with Stage I UCCC were identified of whom 13 (52%) received no adjuvant therapy and 12 (48%) received adjuvant radiation therapy (XRT). The 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival rates for the observation and the XRT groups were 78% and 75%, (p = 0.7) and 85% and 82% (p = 0.1), respectively. When compared to controls, the 5-year disease-free survival rates and overall survival rates of patients with Stage I UCCC were not significantly different, 77% vs 75% (p = 0.8) and 84% vs 88% (p = 0.5), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with Stage I UCCC tumors there was no clear benefit to adjuvant radiation given the absence of improvement in recurrence risk or any survival benefit. These data question the benefit of radiation therapy in UCCC patients with disease confined to the uterus.",cancer"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-type distribution in relation to oral contraceptive use in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, Durban, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To determine HPV-type distribution among women with cervical dysplasia in relation to oral contraceptive usage. METHODS: Prospective cross-sectional study of four groups of patients according to oral contraceptive usage: non-users, users of less than five years duration, users of between five years and ten years, and users of more than ten years duration. Swabs of the cervix were analysed for HPV DNA using the polymerase chain reaction method. RESULTS: A total of 124 women were recruited for the study. There were 75 patients who were HIV-infected (seroprevalence 61%). There were 102 patients who were HPV positive (82%), of which 79 patients had high-risk HPV DNA (78%). In terms of the four oral contraceptive groups, high-risk HPV DNA was detected in 70% (n = 21), 79% (n = 22), 90% (n = 21) and 71% (n = 15) of patient, respectively. The odds of having HPV DNA was six times higher for the combination of contraceptive users of less than five years duration/non-users (OR 5.9, 95% CI: 1.87-18.77). There was no change when adjustment was made for age (OR 6.1, 95% CI: 1.9-19.4). HPV DNA type 16 and/or 18 was present in a total of 21 patients (49%) (non-contraceptive users and users < 5 years duration) versus 15 patients (42%) (oral contraceptive users of more than 5 years duration) (p = 0.524). HPV type 16 was the commonest HPV type detected (20.2%) and HPV type 58 was the next commonest hihg-risk HPV type (16.1%). HPV types 58 and 33 were detected in a much greater percentage of our population and HPV 16 in a much smaller percentage of our population compared with a non-South African population. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study demonstrate an interesting distribution of HPV types in a South African population.",cancer"Molecular markers in epithelial ovarian cancer: their role in prognosis and therapy. Epithelial cancer of the ovary is the most lethal malignancy of all gynaecological cancers. Various clinical and pathological features of ovarian cancer are used as predictors of clinical outcome. The use of molecular markers in common clinical practice seems promising for the diagnosis and prognostication. The aim of this review article is to describe current theories regarding the pathogenesis and molecular evolution of epithelial ovarian cancer. With respect to the molecules involved, this article focuses on whether they are associated with poor prognosis or not. This evaluation is performed in light of the progress made and the potential usefulness in treatment decisions without overlooking existing controversies that should be further studied. It is tempting to anticipate the gradual integration of molecular profiling in clinical practice.",cancer"Hormone therapy/adjuvant chemotherapy induced deleterious effects on the bone mass of breast cancer patients and the intervention of physiotherapy: a literature review. In recent years, breast cancer has witnessed some notable improvements regarding early diagnosis and new therapeutical strategies, mainly because of the utilization of new drugs and systemic treatment protocols, which have had a direct impact in the increase of these patients' global survival rate. At the same time, it is an ever-growing concern among oncology professionals to identify and minimize as much as possible the effects of long-term toxicity resulting from cancer therapies. Within this context, physiotherapy fits as a preventive and rehabilitating factor regarding functional and skeletal alterations, deriving not only from the direct action of breast cancer, but also from the treatment to which these patients are submitted. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to revise the scientific literature on possible adjuvant chemotherapy-induced secondary deleterious effects on the bone mass of patients diagnosed with breast cancer, and also to revise the literature on the intervention of physiotherapy in cases of secondary bone mass loss caused by adjuvant chemotherapy in patients suffering from breast cancer. METHODOLOGY: The research was carried out by consulting the following medical websites: Medicus Medline Index, Lilacs, Sciello, PubMed (National Library of Medicine), Google Academic and Capes (a Brazilian website for scientific information). The selection gathers articles written in different languages, English in special, published from January 1998 to October 2008. RESULTS: 24 studies explicitly mention chemotherapy-induced direct and/or indirect effects upon bone mass. Different authors refer to bone mass loss as one possible secondary deleterious effect resulting from adjuvant chemotherapy applied in breast cancer treatment. Nonetheless, no scientific articles were found on the subject of physiotherapy intervention aimed at patients in this specific condition. CONCLUSION: The results achieved in this revision study point out the possible chemotherapy-induced late deleterious effects on patients diagnosed with breast cancer, as well as the additional risks for the development of further osteoporotic conditions. Hormone therapy and adjuvant chemotherapy treatments may in fact augment and accelerate the loss of bone mass, be it directly, through the action of chemotherapeutical drugs, or indirectly, through the reduction of estrogenic levels and precocious menopause. The scarce material on the rehabilitation of bone mass loss deriving from adjuvant treatments reveals, as it seems, a strong need for new studies on the subject.",cancer"Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy added to the treatment of ovarian cancer. A review of achieved results and complications. OBJECTIVE: The late revelation of ovarian cancer ensures it as the leading cause of death among gynecologic cancers. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and intravenous (i.v.) chemotherapy have been the cornerstone for a long time to treat this disease. More recently, the modality of intraperitoneal administration of chemotherapy under hyperthermic conditions (HIPEC) has been added. This review surveys the results of HIPEC added to CRS in ovarian cancer. METHODS: A multi-database search was conducted focusing on mortality, morbidity and overall and disease-free (DF) survival rates. RESULTS: 16 studies were identified reporting the results of CRS followed by HIPEC of 546 patients with advanced ovarian cancer. Postoperative mortality was reported for 14 out of 481 patients in total (2.9%). The major morbidity rate varied between 3.4 and 50.0%. In all but one study (533 patients), 185 events were reported (34.5%) and 21 re-interventions after 476 operations (4.4%). Survival data ranged from 10.0 to 57.1 months for the DF survival and from 19.0 to 76.1 months for the overall survival. Optimal cytoreduction and recurrent disease were associated with a better outcome in selected cases. CONCLUSIONS: Adding HIPEC to the current treatment modalities for ovarian cancer seems to be feasible. Improved survival rates have been reported at the cost of acceptable mortality rates. Nevertheless, there was a selection bias, the morbidity should not be underestimated and it is unclear yet which patient will benefit most from this treatment. Randomized controlled trials will provide an answer to this question.",cancer"Could the eventual results of the NSABP* 39/RTOG** 0413 trial for partial breast irradiation (PBI) be improved by combining spherical applicators and whole breast irradiation? Radiobiology suggests it may. There may be unacceptable risks associated with the relatively large single doses of irradiation prescribed over five days instead of over six weeks for three of the four trial arms of the NSABP39/RTOG 0413 clinical trial seeking to enlist 4,300 patients. The first arm prescribes 60 Gray (Gy) in two Gy fractions over six weeks, which is the present standard. The dose implications of the other three arms with reference to this standard were examined using the ID2 formalism. Particularly poor (non-homogeneous) dose distributions characterise spherical applicators like ""MammoSite"" used as a sole device for accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). The alternative treatment, APBI done by 3-D conformal radiation, may also have a drawback, namely a sudden sharp cut-off in dose which may cause cosmetic problems due to circumscribed fibrosis and edema. Some recently published results from this trial reveal an alarming level of complications. The possible causes of these complications and poor cosmetic outcomes and how to avoid them are examined. An obstacle to the more widespread use of the ""MammoSite type of device is that the device is not allowed closer than 5-7 mm from the skin or ribs; a possible remedy for this restriction is offered. It is also intended to make the relevant radiobiological principles usable for surgical oncologists.",cancer"Therapeutic choices for curing dysodia?...three clinical cases. These three clinical cases provide an approach to the management of anatomical voice disorders. When confronted with a laryngeal diagnosis, talented musicians often suffer a crisis of self-confidence which may propel them toward maladaptive compensations; these may destabilize their usual techniques, already disrupted by the changes in their vocal acoustics. In their forties, each of these patients presents with an angiomatous lesion of the vocal fold, associated in two of the cases with a congenital structural weakness. For the three of them, the recommended therapeutic choice was alternating recorded laryngoscopic follow-up, alternative medicine prescriptions, and ""artistic sessions"" that required that their phoniatrician adapt to their repertory, their temperament, the constraints of the stage and their laryngeal disorder in order that they achieve a compromise between the needs of their career and the laryngeal anatomic realities of the moment. These ""artistic guidance sessions"" are recorded so as to allow the patient to become aware of the quality of their public performance and to learn the functional elements contributing to it.",cancer"Sixty years of CA: a cancer journal for clinicians. The first issue of CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians was published in November of 1950. On the 60th anniversary of that date, we briefly review several seminal contributions to oncology and cancer control published in our journal during its first decade.",cancer"Phenotypic heterogeneity among tumorigenic melanoma cells from patients that is reversible and not hierarchically organized. We investigated whether melanoma is hierarchically organized into phenotypically distinct subpopulations of tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cells or whether most melanoma cells retain tumorigenic capacity, irrespective of their phenotype. We found 28% of single melanoma cells obtained directly from patients formed tumors in NOD/SCID IL2Rgamma(null) mice. All stage II, III, and IV melanomas obtained directly from patients had common tumorigenic cells. All tumorigenic cells appeared to have unlimited tumorigenic capacity on serial transplantation. We were unable to find any large subpopulation of melanoma cells that lacked tumorigenic potential. None of 22 heterogeneously expressed markers, including CD271 and ABCB5, enriched tumorigenic cells. Some melanomas metastasized in mice, irrespective of whether they arose from CD271(-) or CD271(+) cells. Many markers appeared to be reversibly expressed by tumorigenic melanoma cells.",cancer"FoxOs enforce a progression checkpoint to constrain mTORC1-activated renal tumorigenesis. mTORC1 is a validated therapeutic target for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here, analysis of Tsc1-deficient (mTORC1 hyperactivation) mice uncovered a FoxO-dependent negative feedback circuit constraining mTORC1-mediated renal tumorigenesis. We document robust FoxO activation in Tsc1-deficient benign polycystic kidneys and FoxO extinction on progression to murine renal tumors; murine renal tumor progression on genetic deletion of both Tsc1 and FoxOs; and downregulated FoxO expression in most human renal clear cell and papillary carcinomas, yet continued expression in less aggressive RCCs and benign renal tumor subtypes. Mechanistically, integrated analyses revealed that FoxO-mediated block operates via suppression of Myc through upregulation of the Myc antagonists, Mxi1-SRalpha and mir-145, establishing a FoxO-Mxi1-SRalpha/mir-145 axis as a major progression block in renal tumor development.",cancer"B55beta-associated PP2A complex controls PDK1-directed myc signaling and modulates rapamycin sensitivity in colorectal cancer. The PP2A serine/threonine protein phosphatase serves as a critical cellular regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. However, how this pathway is altered in human cancer to confer growth advantage is largely unknown. Here, we show that PPP2R2B, encoding the B55beta regulatory subunit of the PP2A complex, is epigenetically inactivated by DNA hypermethylation in colorectal cancer. B55beta-associated PP2A interacts with PDK1 and modulates its activity toward Myc phosphorylation. On loss of PPP2R2B, mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin triggers a compensatory Myc phosphorylation in PDK1-dependent, but PI3K and AKT-independent manner, resulting in resistance. Reexpression of PPP2R2B, genetic ablation of PDK1 or pharmacologic inhibition of PDK1 abrogates the rapamycin-induced Myc phosphorylation, leading to rapamycin sensitization. Thus, PP2A-B55beta antagonizes PDK1-Myc signaling and modulates rapamycin sensitivity.",cancer"Hdac3 is essential for the maintenance of chromatin structure and genome stability. Hdac3 is essential for efficient DNA replication and DNA damage control. Deletion of Hdac3 impaired DNA repair and greatly reduced chromatin compaction and heterochromatin content. These defects corresponded to increases in histone H3K9,K14ac; H4K5ac; and H4K12ac in late S phase of the cell cycle, and histone deposition marks were retained in quiescent Hdac3-null cells. Liver-specific deletion of Hdac3 culminated in hepatocellular carcinoma. Whereas HDAC3 expression was downregulated in only a small number of human liver cancers, the mRNA levels of the HDAC3 cofactor NCOR1 were reduced in one-third of these cases. siRNA targeting of NCOR1 and SMRT (NCOR2) increased H4K5ac and caused DNA damage, indicating that the HDAC3/NCOR/SMRT axis is critical for maintaining chromatin structure and genomic stability.",cancer"Recombinant human erythropoietin antagonizes trastuzumab treatment of breast cancer cells via Jak2-mediated Src activation and PTEN inactivation. We found that the receptor for erythropoietin (EpoR) is coexpressed with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) in a significant percentage of human breast tumor specimens and breast cancer cell lines. Exposure of HER2 and EpoR dual-positive breast cancer cells to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) activated cell signaling. Concurrent treatment of the cells with rHuEPO and trastuzumab reduced the cells' response to trastuzumab both in vitro and in vivo. We identified Jak2-mediated activation of Src and inactivation of PTEN as underlying mechanisms through which rHuEPO antagonizes trastuzumab-induced therapeutic effects. Furthermore, we found that compared with administration of trastuzumab alone, concurrent administration of rHuEPO and trastuzumab correlated with shorter progression-free and overall survival in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.",cancer"Aberrant epigenetic landscape in cancer: how cellular identity goes awry. Appropriate patterns of DNA methylation and histone modifications are required to assure cell identity, and their deregulation can contribute to human diseases, such as cancer. Our aim here is to provide an overview of how epigenetic factors, including genomic DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNA regulation, contribute to normal development, paying special attention to their role in regulating tissue-specific genes. In addition, we summarize how these epigenetic patterns go awry during human cancer development. The possibility of ""resetting"" the abnormal cancer epigenome by applying pharmacological or genetic strategies is also discussed.",cancer"Development of ipilimumab: contribution to a new paradigm for cancer immunotherapy. Identification of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) as a key negative regulator of T-cell activity led to development of the fully human, monoclonal antibody ipilimumab to block CTLA-4 and potentiate antitumor T-cell responses. Animal studies first provided insight into the ability of an anti-CTLA-4 antibody to cause tumor regression, particularly in combination regimens. Early clinical studies defined ipilimumab pharmacokinetics and possibilities for combinability. Phase II trials of ipilimumab in advanced melanoma showed objective responses, but a greater number of patients had disease stabilization. In a phase III trial, ipilimumab was the first agent to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival in patients with previously treated, advanced melanoma. The adverse event profile associated with ipilimumab was primarily immune-related. Adverse events can be severe and life-threatening, but most were reversible using treatment guidelines. Ipilimumab monotherapy exhibits conventional and new patterns of activity in advanced melanoma, with a delayed separation of Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The observation of some new response patterns with ipilimumab, which are not captured by standard response criteria, led to novel criteria for the evaluation of immunotherapy in solid tumors. Overall, lessons from the development of ipilimumab contributed to a new clinical paradigm for cancer immunotherapy evolved by the Cancer Immunotherapy Consortium.",cancer"Signaling through OX40 enhances antitumor immunity. The existence of tumor-specific T cells, as well as their ability to be primed in cancer patients, confirms that the immune response can be deployed to combat cancer. However, there are obstacles that must be overcome to convert the ineffective immune response commonly found in the tumor environment to one that leads to sustained destruction of tumor. Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily direct diverse immune functions. OX40 and its ligand, OX40L, are key TNF members that augment T-cell expansion, cytokine production, and survival. OX40 signaling also controls regulatory T-cell differentiation and suppressive function. Studies over the past decade have demonstrated that OX40 agonists enhance antitumor immunity in preclinical models using immunogenic tumors; however, treatment of poorly immunogenic tumors has been less successful. Combining strategies that prime tumor-specific T cells together with OX40 signaling could generate and maintain a therapeutic antitumor immune response.",cancer"Biology and clinical applications of CD40 in cancer treatment. CD40 is a costimulatory molecule widely expressed by immune cells and by neoplastic cells of different histotypes. Engagement of surface CD40 mediates different effects depending on cell type and microenvironment. In particular, CD40 expression on immune cells regulates humoral and cellular immunity, while it has apoptotic and antiproliferative activity on selected neoplastic cells. Thus, CD40 targeting may indirectly affect tumor growth through the activation of immune cells and/or directly by mediating cytotoxic effects on neoplastic cells. Preliminary findings emerging from clinical trials indicate that antibodies to CD40 can induce immune modulation and clinical responses in cancer patients.",cancer"Clinical experiences with anti-CD137 and anti-PD1 therapeutic antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) provide a pharmacological platform to block or activate the function of surface receptors. The immune system has evolved receptor-ligand pairs that repress or empower the cellular immune response, which, if tampered with, unleash more potent cellular immunity against tumor antigens. Agonist antibodies directed against CD137 (4-1BB) on the surface of antigen-primed T lymphocytes increase tumor immunity that is curative against some transplantable murine tumors. A fully human IgG4 anti-CD137 antibody is under development with signs of clinical activity and cases of severe liver toxicity that seem to be on-target and dose-dependent effects. Programmed death-1 (PD1) is a surface molecule delivering inhibitory signals important to maintain T-cell functional silence against their cognate antigens. Interference with PD1 or its ligand PD-L1 (B7-H1) increases antitumor immunity. As a result anti-PD1 and anti-PD-L1 human mAbs are under clinical development. Phase I trials with anti-PD1 mAb have yielded encouraging results with durable objective responses and a reasonable safety profile. As new class of drugs in cancer therapy, immunostimulatory mAbs have resulted in redefinition of tumor response criteria and rethinking of the rationale for combining these among each other and with other strategies.",cancer"The emerging toxicity profiles of anti-CTLA-4 antibodies across clinical indications. The promising new class of immunomodulating antibodies directed against cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) has been extensively tested in clinical trials and found to be active against cutaneous melanoma and other tumor histotypes. Inhibition of CTLA-4 characteristically induces well-identified side effects for which the definition ""immune-related adverse events"" (irAEs) has been proposed. IrAEs mainly include colitis/diarrhea, dermatitis, hepatitis, and endocrinopathies; uveitis, nephritis, and inflammatory myopathy also have been reported occasionally. These unique side effects are likely a direct result of breaking immune tolerance upon CTLA-4 blockade and are generally mild, reversible, and manageable, following specific treatment guidelines that include symptomatic therapies or systemic corticosteroids. However, patient-physician communication and early treatment are also emerging as critical issues to successfully manage irAEs, thus avoiding major complications. The major experience in identifying and managing CTLA-4 treatment-related side effects has derived from studies in melanoma patients; nevertheless, accumulating clinical experiences are clearly demonstrating that irAEs are class-specific events, and that they are fully overlapping in patients with tumors of different histotypes. This review provides an overview of current safety data on CTLA-4 antagonists and of available strategies to optimize their clinical use in cancer patients.",cancer"Update on immunologic therapy with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in melanoma: identification of clinical and biological response patterns, immune-related adverse events, and their management. Immune-modifying monoclonal antibodies may induce or enhance the natural immune response against tumor cells. The complex interaction between antigen-presenting cells and T lymphocytes as an immune response is strongly affected by anti-CD152 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4, CTLA-4)-antibodies. However, specific CTLA-4 antibodies can block the CTLA-4 receptor and thus induce an unrestrained T-cell activation. To this stage, treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma with the CTLA-4 antibodies ipilimumab and tremelimumab has only been investigated within clinical trials. The results of a phase III trial in patients with advanced disease treated with ipilimumab alone or in combination with a peptide vaccination (gp100) recently presented at the 2010 annual meeting of the Ameircan Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) made groundbreaking news as ipilimumab was demonstrated to be the first drug in melanoma treatment to show a significant prolongation of survival time. Patients undergoing treatment with CTLA-4 antibodies may experience immune-related phenomena and adverse events (irAEs) that differ greatly from the well-known adverse events of cytotoxic drugs and which are due to the CTLA-4 antibodies' specific mode of action. This review gives a condensed overview on the mechanisms of action, an update on clinical data of the two CTLA-4 antibodies, ipilimumab and tremelimumab, and detailed recommendations for adverse event management strategies.",cancer"Anti-CTLA-4 antibody therapy: immune monitoring during clinical development of a novel immunotherapy. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4), also known as CD152, is a co-inhibitory molecule that functions to regulate T-cell activation. Antibodies that block the interaction of CTLA-4 with its ligands B7.1 and B7.2 can enhance immune responses, including antitumor immunity. Two CTLA-4-blocking antibodies are presently under clinical investigation: ipilimumab and tremelimumab. CTLA-4 blockade has shown promise in treatment of patients with metastatic melanoma, with a recently completed randomized, double-blind phase III trial demonstrating a benefit in overall survival (OS) in the treated population. However, this approach appears to benefit only a subset of patients. Understanding the mechanism(s) of action of CTLA-4 blockade and identifying prognostic immunologic correlates of clinical endpoints to monitor are presently areas of intense investigation. Several immunologic endpoints have been proposed to correlate with clinical activity. This review will focus on the endpoints of immune monitoring described in studies to date and discuss future areas of additional work needed.",cancer"Brain metastasis in melanoma: clinical activity of CTLA-4 antibody therapy. Melanoma metastasizes frequently to the brain, and brain metastases generally drive the prognosis of melanoma patients. Surgical and radiation therapy improve the outcome of selected melanoma patients with brain metastasis, while systemic treatment using cytotoxic agents still plays a limited role. Temozolomide and fotemustine are preferentially used in melanoma patients with brain metastases in the United States and in Europe, respectively, with modest clinical activity. However, the results obtained with either agent are still limited, and efforts are needed to improve the outcome of these patients who are generally excluded from clinical trials. Among therapeutic agents in development, antibodies that block the interaction of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA-4) with its ligands B7.1 and B7.2 and thus enhance antitumor immune responses have shown clinical benefit in patients with metastatic melanoma, including durable control of brain metastases. This chapter reviews the current data and the rationale for ongoing and future trials of combination cytotoxic plus immunomodulatory therapy by US and Italian multicenter trial groups.",cancer"Clinical studies with anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in non-melanoma indications. Available medical treatments have limited impact on the survival of patients with advanced cancer; therefore, new therapeutic strategies able to generate more effective host's immune responses against neoplastic cells are being actively pursued. Among these, a recent approach involves targeting of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), a key immune checkpoint molecule, by monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Ipilimumab and tremelimumab represent the prototypes of this new class of immunomodulating mAb and have been extensively tested in metastatic melanoma with highly promising results. The clinical activity observed in melanoma has served as a model to exploit the therapeutic potential of CTLA-4 blockade in a variety of human malignancies. Along this line, early-phase trials with anti-CTLA-4 mAbs have been completed or are ongoing in tumors of different histotype. Results are demonstrating the feasibility, safety, and activity of these agents, thus suggesting a promising therapeutic role to be further investigated in phase II/III trials in a wide range of tumors. This review summarizes the main trials with ipilimumab and tremelimumab in tumors of different histotypes, excluding cutaneous melanoma, which is extensively described in other chapters of this issue of Seminars in Oncology.",cancer"Anti-CTLA-4 antibody adjuvant therapy in melanoma. Thus far the development of adjuvant therapies in melanoma has suffered greatly from the lack of effective drugs in stage IV melanoma. Chemotherapy, cytokines, vaccines, and combinations of drugs have been used with minimal success. This has led to adjuvant therapies that are not used uniformly or widely because of the rather marginal benefits, as no consistent and clinically significant impact on survival has been demonstrated. A new development for interferon-based adjuvant therapy seems to be the observation that better effects are observed in patients with lower tumor load and in patients with an ulcerated primary melanoma. A benefit for patients with more advanced lymphnodal involvement is quite unsure, clearly requiring new drugs to be explored. A new era in the treatment of melanoma treatment has arrived with the anti-cytoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (anti-CTLA-4) monoclonal antibodies. The randomized trial in advanced metastatic melanoma demonstrated a clear benefit with prolongation of survival. The anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody ipilimumab has finally changed the landscape. It is therefore only logical that a worldwide adjuvant trial with ipilimumab versus placebo, the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 18071, is ongoing in patients with lymph node metastases, and that another adjuvant trial with ipilimumab compared to high-dose interferon (HDI) is planned in the United States. The EORTC 18071 trial will reach full accrual in 2011 and thus results are expected in 2013 or 2014.",cancer"Clinical development of the anti-CTLA-4 antibody tremelimumab. Tremelimumab (formerly CP-675,206) is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody tested in patients with cancer, of whom the majority have had metastatic melanoma. Clinical trials using tremelimumab demonstrate that this antibody can induce durable tumor regressions (up to 8 years at this time) in 7% to 10% of patients with metastatic melanoma. These tumor responses are mediated by the intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) as demonstrated in patient-derived tumor biopsies. Grade 3 or 4 toxicities in the range of 20% to 25% are mainly inflammatory or autoimmune in nature, which are on-target effects after inhibiting CTLA-4-mediated self-tolerance. The lack of survival advantage in the early analysis of a phase III clinical trial comparing tremelimumab with standard chemotherapy for metastatic melanoma highlights the importance of gaining a better understanding of how this antibody modulates the human immune system and how to better select patients for this mode of therapy.",cancer"Ipilimumab: unleashing the power of the immune system through CTLA-4 blockade. Malignant melanoma is rising faster in incidence than any other malignancy. Long-term remission or ""cure"" is rare and is almost exclusively limited to therapies that stimulate an immune antitumor response. Ipilimumab is a novel targeted human immunostimulatory monoclonal antibody that blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen4 (CTLA-4), an immune-inhibitory site expressed on activated T cells. Ipilimumab is well tolerated as an outpatient infusion therapy. Multiple studies have confirmed significant antimelanoma activity. A randomized trial has documented a survival benefit when ipilimumab was compared to a gp-100 vaccine only arm. The unique mechanism of action of ipilimumab makes assessment of response by conventional criteria difficult. Benefit from ipilimumab can occur after what would be considered progression with World Health Oganization (WHO) or Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. New immune response criteria have been proposed. Therapeutic responses peak between 12 and 24 weeks, with slow responses continuing up to and beyond 12 months. The major drug- related adverse side effects (10%-15% grade 3 or above) are immune-related and consist most commonly of rash, colitis, hypophysitis, thyroiditis, and hepatitis. Colonic perforation can occur and patients with diarrhea have to be monitored carefully with strict adherence to treatment algorithms. Algorithms for the treatment of other adverse side effects have been developed. The treatment of immune-related side effects with immunosuppressive agents, such as corticosteroids, does not appear to impair antitumor response. With proper monitoring and management of side effects, ipilimumab is an extremely safe drug to administer. The benefits of ipilimumab will most certainly extend to other malignancies in the near future.",cancer"Predictive value of CD24 and CD44 for neoadjuvant chemotherapy response and prognosis in primary breast cancer patients. PURPOSE: We investigated the significance of CD24 and CD44 expression for predicting responses to chemotherapy and prognosis in primary breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Diagnosis of breast cancer was confirmed by core needle biopsy, and immunohistochemical studies were performed. Preoperatively, patients received anthracycline-containing chemotherapy. Expression of CD44 and CD24 was assessed immunohistochemically and the relationship with chemotherapy response and with prognosis was analyzed. RESULTS: Between 2001 and 2004, 139 women were enrolled in this study. In the correlation analysis, CD24 expression was negatively associated with pathological response to chemotherapy (p = 0.0003). A machine learning technique with an alternating decision tree (ADTree) showed that four logical rules are involved in predicting the response depending on the combination of CD24, HER2, tumor stage, CD44, progesterone receptor, and patient age. In the survival analysis, patients having CD44 (++) showed a significantly favorable prognosis as compared with others (p = 0.0002). A multivariate analysis showed that CD44 expression had an independent prognostic value (p < .0001). CONCLUSION: We found a significant correlation between CD44 expression and prognosis and between CD24 expression and response to chemotherapy. CD24 and CD44 expressions would be useful predictive markers, although further studies are needed.",cancer"HER-2/neu cytoplasmic staining is correlated with neuroendocrine differentiation in breast carcinoma. HER2 oncoprotein plays an essential role in breast cancer growth and differentiation. Determination of HER2 status contributes not only to predicting survival but also to selecting the patients for anti-HER2 therapy. HER2 protein expressed in human cancer cells often contains variant forms as well as the full-length wild-type form. In the present study, we investigated the subcellular localization of HER2 protein in 1053 primary breast cancer tissues. HER2 protein was stained by various immunohistochemical methods and studied by immunoelectron microscopy to confirm the intracellular localization. Thirty-four of 1053 specimens showed cytoplasmic staining of the intracellular domain of HER2 protein by the HercepTest and CB-11. In contrast, no immunoreactivity to the antibodies against the extracellular domain was observed. None of the 34 specimens showed amplification of the HER2 protein by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Subsequently, we studied the association of the cytoplasmic expression of HER2 with neuroendocrine differentiation. Interestingly, all 34 specimens had some positive signals of neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin, chromogranin A, neuron-specific enolase, and CD56. Although the result is preliminary, it warrants further study on the role of the cytoplasmic variant form of HER2 in breast cancer growth, particularly in the aspect of neuroendocrine differentiation.",cancer"Irradiation-induced p53 expression is attenuated in cells with NQO1 C465T polymorphism. NAD(P)H:quinone acceptor oxidoreductase (NQO) 1 polymorphism is associated with various hematological malignancies, especially infant leukemia or therapy-related leukemias, which involve the rearrangement of mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) gene. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (EBV-LCLs) with either of 2 well known polymorphic variations of C609T and C465T were selected from our archives of EBV-LCL clones and studied the induction of p53 expression after DNA damage. Irradiation of cells with C609T/C609T polymorphism (NQO1 *2*2) did not affect the induction of p53 expression. However, irradiation of cells with C465T/WT polymorphism (NQO1 *1*3) resulted in attenuation of p53 and p21 induction. Our results suggest that increased risk of infant leukemia development in patients with NQO1 *1*3 polymorphism is partially dependent on the inhibition of p53 pathway, though further studies are needed to fully understand the pathological role of C465T variant in the development of childhood leukemia.",cancer"McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS): early and extensive bone fibrous dysplasia involvement and ""mistaken identity"" oophorectomy. BACKGROUND: McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a triad of gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty (GIPP), cafe-au-lait spots (CALS) and fibrous dysplasia (FD) of bone. The extent of the abnormalities is variable. PATIENT AND RESULTS: We report a 3 year old girl with CALS since infancy, FD diagnosed at age of 2.5 years, and at the age of 3 years vaginal bleeding. The ultrasound revealed a cystic mass of the ovary, surgical pathology found ovarian cyst. LHRH stimulation demonstrated GIPP (LH 9.8 mIU/ml and FSH 8.9 mIU/ml; normal LH 1.8-10, FSH 9-26 mIU/ml). Radiographs and bone scans demonstrated FD in multiple bones. Peripheral leucocytes and the ovary were negative for GNAS gene mutations. Treatment with Letrasole interrupted the pubertal development. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the clinical signs of MAS are telling and that timely MAS diagnosis prevents unnecessary oophorectomy. A close follow up is recommended regarding development of endocrine disorders and spreading of FD.",cancer"Genital sanguineous discharge in prepuberty: a case of mullerian papilloma of vagina in a nine-year-old girl. Vaginal bleeding in prepuberty is an alarming symptom that must be carefully investigated. Among quite common causes of genital sanguineous discharge, there are rarer conditions responsible for bleeding at this age like Mullerian papilloma of the genital tract. In this report, we describe a case of Mullerian papilloma of the vagina in a 9-year-old girl. We believe in the importance of a correct clinical setting and histological definition to avoid wrong diagnosis and consequent inadequate treatments. Mullerian papilloma, a benign tumor, can in fact be treated only with local excision.",cancer"Osteochondroma of the coccyx: a case report. Osteochondroma is the most common benign bone tumor. Majority of solitary osteochondromas are asymptomatic however, may give functional impairment due to pain from pressure or mass effect. Osteochondromas occur most often about the knee and picked incidentally, coccygeal osteochondroma however; is a rare occurrence. On a plain radiography, it typically appears as a bony projection with a clear cortex and medulla related to the coccyx. Here we present the case of a 7-year-old child with coccygeal osteochondroma.",cancer"Use of pathway information in molecular epidemiology. Candidate gene studies are generally motivated by some form of pathway reasoning in the selection of genes to be studied, but seldom has the logic of the approach been carried through to the analysis. Marginal effects of polymorphisms in the selected genes, and occasionally pairwise gene-gene or gene-environment interactions,are often presented, but a unified approach to modelling the entire pathway has been lacking. In this review, a variety of approaches to this problem is considered, focusing on hypothesis-driven rather than purely exploratory methods. Empirical modelling strategies are based on hierarchical models that allow prior knowledge about the structure of the pathway and the various reactions to be included as 'prior covariates'. By contrast, mechanistic models aim to describe the reactions through a system of differential equations with rate parameters that can vary between individuals, based on their genotypes. Some ways of combining the two approaches are suggested and Bayesian model averaging methods for dealing with uncertainty about the true model form in either framework is discussed. Biomarker measurements can be incorporated into such analyses, and two-phase sampling designs stratified on some combination of disease, genes and exposures can be an efficient way of obtaining data that would be too expensive or difficult to obtain on a full candidate gene sample. The review concludes with some thoughts about potential uses of pathways in genome-wide association studies.",cancer"Platelets: linking hemostasis and cancer. Platelets are the main cellular component in blood responsible for maintaining the integrity of the cardiovascular system via hemostasis. Platelet dysfunction contributes to a wide range of obvious pathological conditions, such as bleeding or thrombosis, but normal platelet function is also linked to diseases not immediately associated with hemostasis or thrombosis, such as cancer. Since the description of Trousseau syndrome in 1865, various experimental and clinical studies have detailed the interaction of platelets with primary tumors and circulating metastatic tumor cells. Observations have suggested that platelets not only augment the growth of primary tumors via angiogenesis but endow tumor cells physical and mechanical support to evade the immune system and extravasate to secondary organs, the basis of metastatic disease. Many laboratory and animal studies have identified specific targets for antiplatelet therapy that may be advantageous as adjuncts to existing cancer treatments. In this review, we summarize important platelet properties that influence tumorigenesis, including primary tumor growth and metastasis at the molecular level. The studies provide a link between the well-studied paradigms of platelet hemostasis and tumorigenesis.",cancer"The contribution of Langerhans cells to cutaneous malignancy. The skin is at the forefront of environmental exposures, such as ultraviolet radiation and a myriad of chemicals, and is at risk for malignant transformation. The skin is a highly responsive immunological organ that contains a unique population of immature intraepidermal dendritic cells (DCs) called Langerhans cells (LCs). Although LCs show morphological and migratory changes in response to epidermal perturbation, and can function as antigen-presenting cells to activate T cells, their role in carcinogenesis is unknown. Here we review recent studies that have provided clues to the potential roles that LCs might play in the pathogenesis of skin cancer, beyond their stimulation or regulation of adaptive immunity. Understanding this role of LCs might provide new perspectives on the relevance of DC populations that are resident within other epithelial tissues for cancer.",cancer"Recombinant human thyrotropin (rhTSH) aided radioiodine treatment for residual or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer. BACKGROUND: For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) following thyroidectomy, thyroid hormone withdrawal (THW) for four to six weeks has been used for decades to increase serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations in order to enhance iodine-131 uptake by normal thyroid cells and differentiated thyroid tumour cells. Exogenous stimulation with recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone (rhTSH) offers an alternative to THW while avoiding the morbidity of hypothyroidism. However, the efficacy of rhTSH-aided iodine-131 treatment for residual or metastatic DTC has not been prospectively assessed. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of rhTSH-aided radioiodine treatment for normal residual or metastatic DTC. SEARCH STRATEGY: We obtained studies from computerised searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library (all until November 2009), and paper collections of conferences held in Chinese. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled clinical trials and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials comparing the effects of rhTSH with THW on iodine-131 treatment for residual or metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer with at least six months of follow up. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed risk of bias and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Altogether 223 patients with DTC participated in four trials. Overall, studies had a high risk of bias. We found no statistically significant differences between rhTSH and THW treatment in terms of successful ablation rate but significant benefits in radiation exposure to blood and bone marrow. One trial reported on benefits in some domains of health-related quality of life. There were no deaths and no serious adverse effects in DTC patients treated with either rhTSH or THW. Maximum follow up was 12 months. None of the included trials investigated complete or partial remission of metastatic tumour, secondary malignancies or economic outcomes. We did not find sufficient data comparing rhTSH with THW-aided radioiodine treatment for metastatic DTC. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Results from four randomised controlled clinical trials suggest that rhTSH is as effective as THW on iodine-131 thyroid remnant ablation, with limited data on significant benefits in decreased whole body radiation exposure and health-related quality of life. It is still uncertain whether lower iodine-131 doses (1110 MBq or 1850 MBq versus 3700 MBq) are equally effective for remnant ablation under rhTSH stimulation. Randomised controlled clinical trials are needed to guide treatment selection for metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer.",cancer"Pharmacological treatments for fatigue associated with palliative care. BACKGROUND: In healthy individuals, fatigue is a protective response to physical or mental stress, often relieved by rest. By contrast, in palliative care patients fatigue can be severely debilitating, thereby impacting daily activity and quality of life, often with rest not counteracting fatigue. Fatigue frequently occurs in patients with advanced disease and modalities treating cancer often contribute or cause fatigue. Further complicating issues are its multidimensionality, subjective nature, and lack of a consensus definition of fatigue. Pathophysiology is not fully understood and evidence-based treatment approaches are needed. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to determine efficacy of pharmacological treatments on non-specific fatigue in palliative care. The focus was on patients at an advanced stage of disease, including cancer and other chronic diseases associated with fatigue, aiming to relieve fatigue. Studies aiming at curative treatment (e.g. surgical intervention for early breast cancer) were not included. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched EMBASE; Psych Lit, CENTRAL and MEDLINE to June 2009. SELECTION CRITERIA: We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) concerning adult palliative care with focus on pharmacological treatment of fatigue. The primary outcome had to be non-specific fatigue (or related terms such as asthenia). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Results were screened and included if they met the selection criteria. If two or more studies were identified that investigated a specific drug in a population with the same disease, meta-analysis was conducted. In addition, comparison of type of drug investigated in a specific population as well as comparison of frequent adverse effects of fatigue treatment was done by creating overview tables. MAIN RESULTS: More than 2000 publications were screened, and 22 met inclusion criteria. In total, data from 11 drugs and 1632 participants were analysed. Studies investigating amantadine, pemoline, and modafinil in participants with Multiple Sclerosis (MS)-associated fatigue and methylphenidate in patients suffering from advanced cancer and fatigue could be used for meta-analysis. Amantadine in MS and methylphenidate in cancer patients showed a superior effect. Most studies had low participant numbers and were heterogenous. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Based on limited evidence, we cannot recommend a specific drug for treatment of fatigue in palliative care patients. Surprisingly, corticosteroids have not been a research focus for fatigue treatment, although these drugs are frequently used. Recent fatigue research seems to focus on modafinil, which may be beneficial although there is no evidence currently. Amantadine and methylphenidate should be further examined. Consensus regarding fatigue assessment in advanced disease is needed.",cancer"Radical prostatectomy versus watchful waiting for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: The lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of treatment options for clinically localised prostate cancer continues to impact on clinical decision-making. Two such options are radical prostatectomy (RP) and watchful waiting (WW). WW involves providing no initial treatment and monitoring the patient with the intention of providing palliative treatment if there is evidence of disease progression. OBJECTIVES: To compare the beneficial and harmful effects of RP versus WW for the treatment of localised prostate cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, ISI Science Citation Index, DARE and LILACS were searched through 30 July 2010. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing the effects of RP versus WW for clinically localised prostate cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction and quality assessment were carried out independently by two authors. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials met the inclusion criteria. Both trials commenced prior to the widespread availability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening; hence the results may not be applicable to men with PSA-detected disease.One trial (N = 142), conducted in the US, was judged to be of poor quality. All cause (overall) mortality was not significantly different between RP and WW groups after fifteen years of follow up (Hazard Ratio (HR) 0.9 (95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.56 to 1.43).The second trial (N = 695), conducted in Scandinavia, was judged to be of good quality. After 12 years of follow up, the trial results were compatible with a beneficial effect of RP on the risks of overall mortality, prostate cancer mortality and distant metastases compared with WW but the precise magnitude of the effect is uncertain as indicated by the width of the confidence intervals for all estimates (risk difference (RD) -7.1% (95% CI -14.7 to 0.5); RD -5.4% (95% CI -11.1 to 0.2); RD -6.7% (95% CI -13.2 to -0.2), respectively). Compared to WW, RP increased the absolute risks of erectile dysfunction (RD 35% (95% CI 25 to 45)) and urinary leakage (RD 27% (95% CI 17 to 37)). These estimates must be interpreted cautiously as they are derived from data obtained from a self-administered questionnaire survey of a sample of the trial participants (N = 326), no baseline quality of life data were obtained and nerve-sparing surgery was not routinely performed on trial participants undergoing RP. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The existing trials provide insufficient evidence to allow confident statements to be made about the relative beneficial and harmful effects of RP and WW for patients with localised prostate cancer. The results of ongoing trials should help to inform treatment decisions for men with screen-detected localised prostate cancer.",cancer"Screening programmes for the early detection and prevention of oral cancer. BACKGROUND: Oral cancer is an important global healthcare problem, its incidence is increasing and late-stage presentation is common. Screening programmes have been introduced for a number of major cancers and have proved effective in their early detection. Given the high morbidity and mortality rates associated with oral cancer, there is a need to determine the effectiveness of a screening programme for this disease, either as a targeted, opportunistic or population based measure. Evidence exists from modelled data that a visual oral examination of high-risk individuals may be a cost-effective screening strategy and the development and use of adjunctive aids and biomarkers is becoming increasingly common. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of current screening methods in decreasing oral cancer mortality. SEARCH STRATEGY: The following electronic databases were searched: the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register (to 20 May 2010), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library 2010, Issue 2), MEDLINE via OVID (1950 to 20 May 2010), EMBASE via OVID (1980 to 20 May 2010) and CANCERLIT via PubMed (1950 to 20 May 2010). There were no restrictions regarding language or date of publication. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of screening for oral cancer or potentially malignant disorders using visual examination, toluidine blue, fluorescence imaging or brush biopsy. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The original review identified 1389 citations and this update identified an additional 330 studies, highlighting 1719 studies for consideration. Only one study met the inclusion criteria and validity assessment, data extraction and statistics evaluation were undertaken by six independent review authors. MAIN RESULTS: One 9-year RCT has been included (n = 13 clusters: 191,873 participants). There was no statistically significant difference in the age-standardised oral cancer mortality rates for the screened group (16.4/100,000 person-years) and the control group (20.7/100,000 person-years). A 43% reduction in mortality was reported between the intervention cohort (29.9/100,000 person-years) and the control arm (45.4/100,000) for high-risk individuals who used tobacco or alcohol or both, which was statistically significant. However, this study had a number of methodological weaknesses and the associated risk of bias was high. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Although there is evidence that a visual examination as part of a population based screening programme reduced the mortality rate of oral cancer in high-risk individuals, whilst producing a stage shift and improvement in survival rates across the population as a whole, the evidence is limited to one study and is associated with a high risk of bias. This was compounded by the fact that the effect of cluster randomisation was not accounted for in the analysis. Furthermore, no robust evidence was identified to support the use of other adjunctive technologies like toluidine blue, brush biopsy or fluorescence imaging within a primary care environment. Further randomised controlled trials are recommended to assess the efficacy, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a visual examination as part of a population based screening programme.",cancer"Fraction size in radiation treatment for breast conservation in early breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Shortening the duration of radiation therapy would benefit women with early breast cancer treated with breast conserving surgery. It may also improve access to radiation therapy by improving efficiency in radiation oncology departments globally. This can only happen if the shorter treatment is as effective and safe as conventional radiation therapy. This is an updated version of the original Cochrane Review published in Issue 3, 2008. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of altered radiation fraction size on outcomes for women with early breast cancer who have undergone breast conserving surgery. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group Specialised Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the WHO ICTRP search portal to June 2009, reference lists of articles and relevant conference proceedings. We applied no language constraints. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of unconventional versus conventional fractionation in women with early breast cancer who had undergone breast conserving surgery. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The authors performed data extraction independently, with disagreements resolved by discussion. We sought missing data from trial authors. MAIN RESULTS: Four trials reported on 7095 women. The women were highly selected: tumours were node negative and 89.8% were smaller than 3 cm. Where the breast size was known, 87% had small or medium breasts. The studies were of low to medium quality. Unconventional fractionation (delivering radiation therapy in larger amounts each day but over fewer days than with conventional fractionation) did not affect: (1) local recurrence risk ratio (RR) 0.97 (95% CI 0.76 to 1.22, P = 0.78), (2) breast appearance RR 1.17 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.39, P = 0.09), (3) survival at five years RR 0.89 (95% CI 0.77 to 1.04, P = 0.16). Acute skin toxicity was decreased with unconventional fractionation: RR 0.21 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.64, P = 0.007). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Two new studies have been published since the last version of the review, altering our conclusions. We have evidence from four low to medium quality randomised trials that using unconventional fractionation regimens (greater than 2 Gy per fraction) does not affect local recurrence, is associated with decreased acute toxicity and does not seem to affect breast appearance or late toxicity for selected women treated with breast conserving therapy. These are mostly women with node negative tumours smaller than 3 cm and negative pathological margins. Long-term follow up (> 5 years) is available for a small proportion of the patients randomised. Longer follow up is required for a more complete assessment of the effect of altered fractionation.",cancer"Addition of drug/s to a chemotherapy regimen for metastatic breast cancer. BACKGROUND: The addition of a chemotherapy drug or drugs to an established regimen is one method used to increase the dose and intensity of treatment for metastatic breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of adding one or more chemotherapy drugs to an established regimen in women with metastatic breast cancer. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group's Specialised Register (to August 2009) using the codes for ""advanced breast cancer"" and ""chemotherapy"". This review is an update of the original Cochrane Review (Issue 3, 2006). SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised trials with a first line regimen of at least two chemotherapy drugs compared to the same regimen plus the addition of one or more chemotherapy drugs in women with metastatic breast cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors extracted data independently from published trials. We derived hazard ratios (HR) from time-to-event outcomes where possible, and used a fixed-effect model for meta-analysis. We analysed response rates as dichotomous variables and extracted toxicity data where available. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 17 trials reporting on 22 treatment comparisons (2674 patients randomised). Fifteen trials (20 treatment comparisons) reported results for tumour response and 11 trials (14 treatment comparisons) published time-to-event data for overall survival. There were 1532 deaths in 2116 women randomised to trials of the addition of a drug to the regimen and control (the regimen alone). There was no detectable difference in overall survival between these patients, with an overall HR of 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.07, P = 0.47) and no significant heterogeneity. We found no difference in time to progression between these regimens, with an overall HR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.07, P = 0.31) and no significant heterogeneity. Addition of a drug to the regimen was favourably associated with overall tumour response rates (odds ratio 1.21, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.44, P = 0.04) although we observed significant heterogeneity for this outcome across the trials. Where measured, acute toxicities such as alopecia, nausea and vomiting and leucopenia were more common with the addition of a drug. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The addition of one or more drugs to the regimen shows a statistically significant advantage for tumour response in women with metastatic breast cancer but the results suggest no difference in survival time or time to progression. The positive effect on tumour response was also associated with increased toxicity.",cancer"Prophylactic mastectomy for the prevention of breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Recent progress in understanding the genetic basis of breast cancer has increased interest in prophylactic mastectomy (PM) as a method of preventing breast cancer. OBJECTIVES: (i) To determine whether prophylactic mastectomy reduces death rates from any cause in women who have never had breast cancer and in women who have a history of breast cancer in one breast, and (ii) to examine the effect of prophylactic mastectomy on other endpoints, including breast cancer incidence, breast cancer mortality, disease-free survival, physical morbidity, and psychosocial outcomes. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, 2002), MEDLINE and Cancerlit (1966 to June 2006), EMBASE (1974 to June 2006), and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) search portal (until June 2006). Studies in English were included. SELECTION CRITERIA: Participants included women at risk for breast cancer in at least one breast. Interventions included all types of mastectomy performed for the purpose of preventing breast cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two authors independently abstracted data. Data were summarized descriptively; quantitative meta-analysis was not feasible due to heterogeneity of study designs and insufficient reporting. Data were analyzed separately for bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (BPM) and contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM). MAIN RESULTS: All 39 included studies were observational studies with some methodological limitations; randomized trials were absent. The studies presented data on 7,384 women with a wide range of risk factors for breast cancer who underwent PM.BPM studies on the incidence of breast cancer and/or disease-specific mortality reported reductions after BPM particularly for those with BRCA1/2 mutations. For CPM, studies consistently reported reductions in incidence of contralateral breast cancer but were inconsistent about improvements in disease-specific survival. Only one study attempted to control for multiple differences between intervention groups and this study showed no overall survival advantage for CPM at 15 years. Another study showed significantly improved survival following CPM but after adjusting for bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy, the CPM effect on all-cause mortality was no longer significant.Sixteen studies assessed psychosocial measures; most reported high levels of satisfaction with the decision to have PM but more variable satisfaction with cosmetic results. Worry over breast cancer was significantly reduced after BPM when compared both to baseline worry levels and to the groups who opted for surveillance rather than BPM.Case series reporting on adverse events from PM with or without reconstruction reported rates of unanticipated re-operations from 4% in those without reconstruction to 49% in patients with reconstruction. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Sixteen studies have been published since the last version of the review, without altering our conclusions. While published observational studies demonstrated that BPM was effective in reducing both the incidence of, and death from, breast cancer, more rigorous prospective studies (ideally randomized trials) are needed. BPM should be considered only among those at very high risk of disease. There is insufficient evidence that CPM improves survival and studies that control for multiple confounding variables are needed.",cancer"HPV/cervical cancer vaccination: parental preferences on age, place and information needs. INTRODUCTION: A vaccine against cervical cancer is available in New Zealand through school and primary care for girls aged 12-18 years. Factors that might increase or hinder widespread uptake by the target population need to be identified. AIM: To describe parents' preferences on where their daughter(s) receive the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, at what age, and their information needs. METHODS: 3123 questionnaires were distributed to parents recruited from 14 schools in 2008, prior to the start of the school-based vaccination programme. Outcome measures were: preferred age and place of vaccination, and information needs of parents and their daughters. Tests for significance were performed to determine whether parental preferences differed by ethnic group (Maori, Pacific, New Zealand European and 'Other'). RESULTS: A 25% response rate was achieved (769/3123). Receipt of the HPV vaccine in a clinic setting was preferred by 40% of parents; 25% preferred vaccination at school. Fifty percent preferred vaccination to occur at age 13 or older; 28% thought ages 10, 11 or 12 appropriate. One in three parents wanted more information and 65% said they would seek information from their family doctor before deciding on the vaccine for their daughter(s). DISCUSSION: We suggest that a programme delivered jointly in primary care and school settings, that is appropriately resourced for follow-up and information-sharing, would increase vaccine coverage. The rationale for vaccination at age 12 needs to be made clear to parents and evidence-based information needs to be delivered appropriately to parents and girls.",cancer"Paying ""particle"" attention to novel melanoma treatment strategies. Malignant melanoma remains the deadliest form of skin cancer because of its highly aggressive nature and the lack of effective treatments. Recent investigations into alternative treatment strategies have highlighted the exciting potential of nanoparticles to increase melanoma cell delivery and the efficacy of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and pharmacological inhibitors. In this issue, Chen et al. report a new liposomal nanoparticle for c-Myc siRNA delivery, noting it to be highly effective in reducing c-Myc expression and inhibiting melanoma tumor growth in mouse models. This preclinical study underscores the importance of investigating nanoparticle treatment options for chemoresistant melanomas.",cancer"Risk of colorectal cancer in men on long-term androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. BACKGROUND: Androgen deprivation with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists or orchiectomy is a common but controversial treatment for prostate cancer. Uncertainties remain about its use, particularly with increasing recognition of serious side effects. In animal studies, androgens protect against colonic carcinogenesis, suggesting that androgen deprivation may increase the risk of colorectal cancer. METHODS: We identified 107 859 men in the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1993 through 2002, with follow-up available through 2004. The primary outcome was development of colorectal cancer, determined from SEER files on second primary cancers. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to assess the influence of androgen deprivation on the outcome, adjusted for patient and prostate cancer characteristics. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Men who had orchiectomies had the highest unadjusted incidence rate of colorectal cancer (6.3 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.3 to 7.5), followed by men who had GnRH agonist therapy (4.4 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI = 4.0 to 4.9), and men who had no androgen deprivation (3.7 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI = 3.5 to 3.9). After adjustment for patient and prostate cancer characteristics, there was a statistically significant dose-response effect (P(trend) = .010) with an increasing risk of colorectal cancer associated with increasing duration of androgen deprivation. Compared with the absence of these treatments, there was an increased risk of colorectal cancer associated with use of GnRH agonist therapy for 25 months or longer (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.12 to 1.53) or with orchiectomy (HR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.14 to 1.66). CONCLUSION: Long-term androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.",cancer"Targeted intervention strategies to increase and maintain mammography utilization among African American women. OBJECTIVES: We assessed the impact of a theory-based, culturally relevant intervention designed to increase mammography screening among African American women in 8 underserved counties in Alabama. METHODS: Using principles derived from the Stages of Change, Community Health Advisor, and Community Empowerment models, we developed strategies to increase mammography screening. Trained volunteers (N = 143) provided tailored messages to encourage adoption and maintenance of mammography screening. We collected baseline and follow-up data on 1513 women in the communities targeted for the intervention. Our goal was to decrease the number of women in stage 1 (never screened) while increasing the number of women in stage 2 (infrequently screened) and stage 3 (regularly screened). RESULTS: At baseline, 14% (n = 211) of the women were in stage 1, 16% (n = 247) were in stage 2, and 70% (n = 1055) were in stage 3. After the 2-year intervention, 4% (n = 61) of the women remained in stage 1, 20% (n = 306) were in stage 2, and 76% (n = 1146) were in stage 3. CONCLUSIONS: Tailored motivational messages and peer support can increase mammography screening rates for African American women.",cancerSequencing of DC-SIGN promoter indicates an association between promoter variation and risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in cantonese. BACKGROUND: The dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) is an important pathogen recognition receptor of the innate immune system. DC-SIGN promoter variants play important role in the susceptibility to various infectious diseases. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy that is common in southern China and whether DC-SIGN promoter variants have effects on susceptibility to NPC is still unknown. The aim of this study is to ascertain the potential involvement of DC-SIGN promoter single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in NPC susceptibility. METHODS: We conducted a case control study based on Cantonese population including 444 NPC patients and 464 controls matched on age and sex. The 1041 bp of DC-SIGN promoter region was directly sequenced for all samples. Sequence alignment and SNP search were inspected using DNAStar analysis programs and haplotype frequencies were estimated in Haploview V 4.0. The associations between the SNPs and the risk of NPC were analyzed using chi-square test and non-conditional logistic regression analysis with SPSS 13.0 software. RESULTS: A total of six variants were observed in the DC-SIGN promoter region and DC-SIGN -139 GG and -939 AA were significantly associated with NPC risk with adjusted Odds Ratios (ORs) of 2.10 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23-3.59; P = 0.006) and 2.52 (1.29-4.93; P = 0.007) respectively and subjects carrying the risk allele DC-SIGN -871 G had 1.47-fold (95% CI = 1.14-1.90) increased risks of developing NPC (P = 0.003). Haplotype analysis revealed that h1 'AAAG' was significantly associated with protection against NPC (OR = 0.69; P = 0.0002) and the association was still significant when using 1000 permutation test runs (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicated that DC-SIGN promoter variants appear to be involved in the susceptibility to NPC and the detailed mechanism of this effect need further studies.,cancer"Triple-negative breast cancer. Triple-negative breast cancer, so called because it lacks expression of the estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and HER2, is often, but not always, a basal-like breast cancer. This review focuses on its origin, molecular and clinical characteristics, and treatment.",cancer"DNMT3A mutations in acute myeloid leukemia. BACKGROUND: The genetic alterations responsible for an adverse outcome in most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are unknown. METHODS: Using massively parallel DNA sequencing, we identified a somatic mutation in DNMT3A, encoding a DNA methyltransferase, in the genome of cells from a patient with AML with a normal karyotype. We sequenced the exons of DNMT3A in 280 additional patients with de novo AML to define recurring mutations. RESULTS: A total of 62 of 281 patients (22.1%) had mutations in DNMT3A that were predicted to affect translation. We identified 18 different missense mutations, the most common of which was predicted to affect amino acid R882 (in 37 patients). We also identified six frameshift, six nonsense, and three splice-site mutations and a 1.5-Mbp deletion encompassing DNMT3A. These mutations were highly enriched in the group of patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile (56 of 166 patients, or 33.7%) but were absent in all 79 patients with a favorable-risk cytogenetic profile (P<0.001 for both comparisons). The median overall survival among patients with DNMT3A mutations was significantly shorter than that among patients without such mutations (12.3 months vs. 41.1 months, P<0.001). DNMT3A mutations were associated with adverse outcomes among patients with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile or FLT3 mutations, regardless of age, and were independently associated with a poor outcome in Cox proportional-hazards analysis. CONCLUSIONS: DNMT3A mutations are highly recurrent in patients with de novo AML with an intermediate-risk cytogenetic profile and are independently associated with a poor outcome.

Tumors of and trauma to the trachea and bronchi can result in loss of integrity of the airway and death. Once treated primarily with thoracic surgery, these conditions are increasingly being managed with interventional pulmonary procedures outside the operating room but requiring the assistance of anesthetists. These interventional procedures require airway instrumentation, necessitating anesthesia care for ventilation and obtundation of airway reflexes. A thorough preoperative assessment and consultation with the pulmonologist or surgeon performing the procedure are essential for successful completion of the tumor and scar reduction and subsequent stent placement. In addition, anesthetists may care for patients undergoing nonpulmonary surgery who have an existing bronchial or tracheal stent or patients requiring correction of displaced stents. A discussion on the preferred methods for caring for patients in these situations is included.",cancer"Gastrosplenic fistula: etiologies, diagnostic studies, and surgical management. A gastrosplenic fistula is a rare event. Reported causes include a spontaneous malignant fistula, chemotherapy for gastric or splenic malignancies, peptic ulcer disease, Crohn disease, and trauma. We report a case of a gastrosplenic fistula discovered on abdominal computed tomography with contrast, performed in a patient with a history suspicious for malignancy. In this case, no etiology was identified prior to the surgical repair of the lesion despite extensive workup. Due to continued gastrointestinal blood loss requiring multiple transfusions, the patient was taken to surgery for splenectomy and partial gastrectomy. It was at that time that the diagnosis of a large B-cell lymphoma was made. Postoperative chemotherapy was initiated and led to remission of the malignancy. Though most cases require definitive surgical repair, the treatment plans for gastrosplenic fistulas depend largely on the etiology of the lesion.",cancer"Fat replacement of the distal pancreas in a case of advanced gastric cancer. Preoperative computed tomography in a 67-year-old man admitted with type 2 advanced gastric cancer involving the upper body of the stomach revealed marked atrophy of the left lobe of the liver and atrophy of the distal pancreas. Total gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection was planned; however, additional distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was also performed during the operation because of direct invasion of the pancreas by the gastric cancer. Histopathologic examination of the resected pancreas revealed the absence of lobules, acini, conduits, and pancreatic ducts, with only islets of Langerhans found scattered in the adipose tissue. The findings revealed that the gastric cancer had directly invaded the fat, replacing the distal pancreas. In patients with fat-replaced pancreas, preoperative evaluation of direct invasion of adjacent organs/tissues by gastric cancer is difficult.",cancer"Preoperative imaging diagnosis of carotid body tumors. Carotid body tumors (CBTs) are relatively frequent lesions encountered at high altitudes, such in as the Andean Mountains. A correct preoperative diagnosis is essential for surgical planning and performance. For this reason, we have reviewed the evolution of our experience in the imaging diagnosis of these tumors. Between 1980 and June 2008, 160 CBTs were diagnosed. A total of 138 tumors were operated on, 4 are waiting for surgery, and 18 were not operated on because of age, medical conditions, or patient refusal. We have reviewed retrospectively the modalities of imaging diagnosis in our patients who underwent operation. Among the 138 tumors operated on, a correct preoperative diagnosis was done in 127 cases (92%). The preoperative diagnosis of the remaining 11 patients was unspecified benign tumor for 6 patients and neck lymph node for 5 patients. The imaging methods performed by different radiologists were conventional ultrasound, color Doppler ultrasound, carotid conventional angiography (CA), axial tomography, magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance angiography, and computed tomographic angiography (CTA). Most patients had more than one image study. Review of radiologist reports revealed a correct diagnosis in all carotid CA, magnetic resonance studies, and CTA. Additionally, CTA appeared to be a valuable method to predict the Shamblin group. Clinical suspicion and current image techniques permit a correct diagnosis in practically all cases of CBT.",cancer"Clinical and dermoscopic progression of subungual hematomas. Subungual pigmentation is a very common problem and can result from pigments derived from melanin, blood, or fungi. Subungual hematoma usually appears as a reddish to reddish-black pigment depending on the age of the bleed, and it can easily be misdiagnosed as melanoma. In this study, we tried to show the clinical and dermoscopic progression of subungual hematomas. Thirty-six patients with the history of first nail trauma within the last 7 days were included in the study. All the patients were evaluated three times with 3-week intervals. The distance from proximal nail fold to the hematoma was measured by a paper ruler. The area and the largest diameter of the hematoma were calculated by using the Molescore software. At the beginning, the most common dermoscopic finding was the homogen area (n = 36, 100%) followed by small globules (n = 32, 88.9%), large globules (n = 29, 80.6%), and streaks (n = 19, 52.8%). At week 3, the most common dermoscopic finding was the homogen area (n = 36, 100%) followed by large globules (n = 27, 75%), small globules (n = 19, 52.8%), and streaks (n = 11, 30.6%). At the sixth week, the most common dermoscopic finding was homogen area (n = 36, 100%) followed by large globules (n = 16, 44.4%), small globules (n = 7, 19.4%), and streaks (n = 2, 5.6%). The diameter and the area of the hematoma shrunk gradually between weeks 0, 3, and 6 (P < 0.001). Dermoscopy is a very useful tool in the evaluation and differential diagnosis of subungual hematomas. Determination that the pigmented plague grows out distally and shrinks gradually will support the diagnosis of subungual hematoma.",cancer"The effectiveness of transverse coloplasty in patients with ultra-lower rectal cancer. Rectal cancer accounts for 40% of colon cancer, and postoperative defecatory function is considered to markedly affect the patients' quality of life. We performed transverse coloplasty in 33 patients with rectal cancer who had undergone an anal function preservation operation in which the anastomotic site was within 1 cm of the dentate line (ultra-low anterior resection) and evaluated its effectiveness in controlling the patients' defecatory function. The average daily defecation frequency 1, 6, and 12 months postoperatively was 7.8, 5, and 3.6 times daily following straight colorectal reconstruction (the anastomotic site was more than 5 cm from the dentate line) and 7.5, 3.5, and 2.4 times daily following transverse coloplasty, respectively. Concerning postoperative complications, anastomotic leakage, soiling, and constipation were observed in 1, 1, and 1 cases, respectively. Transverse coloplasty can be performed in a short time, and it is considered a safe and useful method to manage defecatory",cancer"Significance of PET/CT in determining actual TNM staging for patients with various lung cancers. We investigated the difference in TNM stage of lung cancer provided by PET/CT (combining positron emission tomography and computed tomography) as compared with TNM stage obtained with conventional imaging studies (CI) with contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with iron contrast media. Sixty-seven cases of lung cancer were included in this study. Overall, the rate of correction of TNM staging was 70.1% after PET/CT. The correction rate for each factor was 32.8% in T, 37.3% in N, and 37.3% in M. High rates of correction were observed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC), with 75% (6/8 cases) obtained by PET/CT. When SCLCs were divided into limited disease (n = 6) involving 1 hemithorax, including mediastinal and contralateral hilar lymph nodes, and others (extensive disease, n = 2), the correction rate was as high as 80% for limited disease. In conclusion, PET/CT can provide actual TNM staging and recognition for oncologists in staging, which would not mislead to selection of inadequate subsequent treatment.",cancer"Radical perineal prostatectomy: the first experience. OBJECTIVE: to present relatively uncommon surgical procedure for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six patients with localized prostate cancer (PCa) underwent perineal radical prostatectomy (PRP) from 2006 to 2010. The average age was 65 +/- 5.2 years. The average preoperative PSA was 7.8 +/- 1.3 ng/ml. Two patients had pT2b stage, while four had pT2c stage. Gleason score ranged from 4-7. RESULTS: All patients had negative surgical margins. Average operative time was 109 +/- 20 minutes and average blood loss was 525 +/- 180 ml. The urethral catheter was removed after 12 days in all patients except one, who required prolonged catheterization due to urinary fistula. All patients were continent after three months. Average postoperative PSA was 0.07 +/- 0.03 ng/ml. CONCLUSION: Perineal radical prostatectomy is valuable surgical procedure that provides good oncological results as well as urinary and sexual function.",cancer"Single incision laparoscopic anterior resection for cancer using a ""QuadiPort access system"". BACKGROUND: Single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) is developing rapidly and different devices are already available. However there is limited data in the literature about single port laparoscopic colorectal surgery. AIMS: We report the first case of a single incision laparoscopic anterior resection for cancer using the device ""QuadiPort Access System. METHODS: A 66 year old female affected by adenocarcinoma of the rectosigmoid junction underwent a radical single incision laparoscopic anterior resection performed by an experienced laparoscopic team. RESULTS: The preoperative staging was T2NOM0. The total operative time was 135 min. Length of hospital stay was 6 days. The length of the specimen was 27 cm and 21 nodes were isolated. The pathological examination showed adenocarcinoma staged T3N2MX; G2. There was no postoperative morbidity and at the 6 month follow-up, the patient presented in well condition with no complications and free from cancer. CONCLUSION: Single incision laparoscopic anterior resection for locally advanced high rectal cancer seems to be feasible and the ""QuadiPort Access System seems to be a valid device. To evaluate outcomes and costeffectiveness of SILS versus the standard laparoscopic colorectal surgery multicenter prospective randomised trials are necessary and the ""QuadiPort Access System"" could prove to be the device of choice.",cancer"From mininvasive to maxinvasive surgery in colorectal cancer: modem evolution of oncologic specialized units. In the last years a wide range of new technique offers the possibility to have R0 resection in colorectal cancer. We report our experience about Single Port Laparoscopic Surgery (SPL) for not advanced right colon cancer and about pelvectomy with cilindric Abdominal Perineal Resection (APR) for advanced rectal cancer. SPL offer mainly cosmetic advantages but also quicker recovery. No touch technique with adequate surgical margin and lymphectomy were respected. Operative time of SPL was 85-115 minutes, the incision was 5 cm long. There were no complications. Length of hospital stay was 4-6 days. With advanced pelvic cancer, pelvic exenteration with en-bloc resection is indicated. Then we propose a case of a 55 years old woman with a pelvic recurrence from a metastatic rectal cancer involving the right obturator fossa, the vaginal stump, the right ureter. Modern surgical technique give us the chance to offer the most appropriate oncologic surgical treatment.",cancer"Disease awareness and knowledge in caregivers of children who had surgery for cystic hydatid disease in Lima, Peru. Cystic hydatid disease (CHD) is a common cause of lung and liver disease worldwide. Despite Peru being highly endemic, information about the level of knowledge is scarce and poor. A telephone survey was applied to assess the knowledge in the caregivers of patients treated for CHD at a paediatric hospital at Lima, Peru. Of the 26 contacted families, only 5 (20%) answered correctly all seven questions. A higher education degree was associated with correct answers (P = 0.002). Most respondents (17, 65%) incorrectly identified the etiologic agent and mode of transmission.

Professionalism may not be sufficient to drive the profound and far-reaching changes needed in the US health care system, but without it, the health care enterprise is lost. Formal statements defining professionalism have been abstract and principle based, without a clear description of what professional behaviors look like in practice. This article proposes a behavioral and systems view of professionalism that provides a practical approach for physicians and the organizations in which they work. A more behaviorally oriented definition makes the pursuit of professionalism in daily practice more accessible and attainable. Professionalism needs to evolve from being conceptualized as an innate character trait or virtue to sophisticated competencies that can and must be taught and refined over a lifetime of practice. Furthermore, professional behaviors are profoundly influenced by the organizational and environmental context of contemporary medical practice, and these external forces need to be harnessed to support--not inhibit--professionalism in practice. This perspective on professionalism provides an opportunity to improve the delivery of health care through education and system-level reform.",nocancer"Prenatal micronutrient supplementation and intellectual and motor function in early school-aged children in Nepal. CONTEXT: Iron and zinc are important for the development of both intellectual and motor skills. Few studies have examined whether iron and zinc supplementation during gestation, a critical period of central nervous system development, affects children's later functioning. OBJECTIVE: To examine intellectual and motor functioning of children whose mothers received micronutrient supplementation during pregnancy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort follow-up of 676 children aged 7 to 9 years in June 2007-April 2009 who had been born to women in 4 of 5 groups of a community-based, double-blind, randomized controlled trial of prenatal micronutrient supplementation between 1999 and 2001 in rural Nepal. Study children were also in the placebo group of a subsequent preschool iron and zinc supplementation trial. INTERVENTIONS: Women whose children were followed up had been randomly assigned to receive daily iron/folic acid, iron/folic acid/zinc, or multiple micronutrients containing these plus 11 other micronutrients, all with vitamin A, vs a control group of vitamin A alone from early pregnancy through 3 months postpartum. These children did not receive additional micronutrient supplementation other than biannual vitamin A supplementation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Children's intellectual functioning, assessed using the Universal Nonverbal Intelligence Test (UNIT); tests of executive function, including go/no-go, the Stroop test, and backward digit span; and motor function, assessed using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (MABC) and finger-tapping test. RESULTS: The difference across outcomes was significant (Bonferroni-adjusted P < .001) for iron/folic acid vs control but not for other supplement groups. The mean UNIT T score in the iron/folic acid group was 51.7 (SD, 8.5) and in the control group was 48.2 (SD, 10.2), with an adjusted mean difference of 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06-4.70; P = .04). Differences were not significant between the control group and either the iron/folic acid/zinc (0.73; 95% CI, -0.95 to 2.42) or multiple micronutrient (1.00; 95% CI, -0.55 to 2.56) groups. In tests of executive function, scores were better in the iron/folic acid group relative to the control group for the Stroop test (adjusted mean difference in proportion who failed, -0.14; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.04) and backward digit span (adjusted mean difference, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.01-0.71) but not for the go/no-go test. The MABC score was lower (better) in the iron/folic acid group compared with the control group but not after adjustment for confounders (mean difference, -1.47; 95% CI, -3.06 to 0.12; P = .07). Finger-tapping test scores were higher (mean difference, 2.05; 95% CI, 0.87-3.24; P = .001) in the iron/folic acid group. CONCLUSION: Aspects of intellectual functioning including working memory, inhibitory control, and fine motor functioning among offspring were positively associated with prenatal iron/folic acid supplementation in an area where iron deficiency is prevalent.

BACKGROUND: Several countries use hospital-wide mortality rates to evaluate the quality of hospital care, although the usefulness of this metric has been questioned. Massachusetts policymakers recently requested an assessment of methods to calculate this aggregate mortality metric for use as a measure of hospital quality. METHODS: The Massachusetts Division of Health Care Finance and Policy provided four vendors with identical information on 2,528,624 discharges from Massachusetts acute care hospitals from October 1, 2004, through September 30, 2007. Vendors applied their risk-adjustment algorithms and provided predicted probabilities of in-hospital death for each discharge and for hospital-level observed and expected mortality rates. We compared the numbers and characteristics of discharges and hospitals included by each of the four methods. We also compared hospitals' standardized mortality ratios and classification of hospitals with mortality rates that were higher or lower than expected, according to each method. RESULTS: The proportions of discharges that were included by each method ranged from 28% to 95%, and the severity of patients' diagnoses varied widely. Because of their discharge-selection criteria, two methods calculated in-hospital mortality rates (4.0% and 5.9%) that were twice the state average (2.1%). Pairwise associations (Pearson correlation coefficients) of discharge-level predicted mortality probabilities ranged from 0.46 to 0.70. Hospital-performance categorizations varied substantially and were sometimes completely discordant. In 2006, a total of 12 of 28 hospitals that had higher-than-expected hospital-wide mortality when classified by one method had lower-than-expected mortality when classified by one or more of the other methods. CONCLUSIONS: Four common methods for calculating hospital-wide mortality produced substantially different results. This may have resulted from a lack of standardized national eligibility and exclusion criteria, different statistical methods, or fundamental flaws in the hypothesized association between hospital-wide mortality and quality of care.

BACKGROUND: There are few studies on long-term mortality in prospectively followed, well-characterized cohorts of children with epilepsy. We report on long-term mortality in a Finnish cohort of subjects with a diagnosis of epilepsy in childhood. METHODS: We assessed seizure outcomes and mortality in a population-based cohort of 245 children with a diagnosis of epilepsy in 1964; this cohort was prospectively followed for 40 years. Rates of sudden, unexplained death were estimated. The very high autopsy rate in the cohort allowed for a specific diagnosis in almost all subjects. RESULTS: Sixty subjects died (24%); this rate is three times as high as the expected age- and sex-adjusted mortality in the general population. The subjects who died included 51 of 107 subjects (48%) who were not in 5-year terminal remission (i.e., >/=5 years seizure-free at the time of death or last follow-up). A remote symptomatic cause of epilepsy (i.e., a major neurologic impairment or insult) was also associated with an increased risk of death as compared with an idiopathic or cryptogenic cause (37% vs. 12%, P<0.001). Of the 60 deaths, 33 (55%) were related to epilepsy, including sudden, unexplained death in 18 subjects (30%), definite or probable seizure in 9 (15%), and accidental drowning in 6 (10%). The deaths that were not related to epilepsy occurred primarily in subjects with remote symptomatic epilepsy. The cumulative risk of sudden, unexplained death was 7% at 40 years overall and 12% in an analysis that was limited to subjects who were not in long-term remission and not receiving medication. Among subjects with idiopathic or cryptogenic epilepsy, there were no sudden, unexplained deaths in subjects younger than 14 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood-onset epilepsy was associated with a substantial risk of epilepsy-related death, including sudden, unexplained death. The risk was especially high among children who were not in remission.

BACKGROUND: There are various regimens for thromboprophylaxis after hip replacement. Low-molecular-weight heparins such as enoxaparin predominantly inhibit factor Xa but also inhibit thrombin to some degree. Orally active, specific factor Xa inhibitors such as apixaban may provide effective thromboprophylaxis with a lower risk of bleeding and improved ease of use. METHODS: In this double-blind, double-dummy study, we randomly assigned 5407 patients undergoing total hip replacement to receive apixaban at a dose of 2.5 mg orally twice daily or enoxaparin at a dose of 40 mg subcutaneously every 24 hours. Apixaban therapy was initiated 12 to 24 hours after closure of the surgical wound; enoxaparin therapy was initiated 12 hours before surgery. Prophylaxis was continued for 35 days after surgery, followed by bilateral venographic studies. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of asymptomatic or symptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause during the treatment period. Patients were followed for an additional 60 days after the last intended dose of study medication. RESULTS: A total of 1949 patients in the apixaban group (72.0%) and 1917 patients in the enoxaparin group (71.0%) could be evaluated for the primary efficacy analysis. The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 27 patients in the apixaban group (1.4%) and in 74 patients in the enoxaparin group (3.9%) (relative risk with apixaban, 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.22 to 0.54; P<0.001 for both noninferiority and superiority; absolute risk reduction, 2.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 1.5 to 3.5). The composite outcome of major and clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding occurred in 129 of 2673 patients assigned to apixaban (4.8%) and 134 of 2659 assigned to enoxaparin (5.0%) (absolute difference in risk, -0.2 percentage points; 95% CI, -1.4 to 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients undergoing hip replacement, thromboprophylaxis with apixaban, as compared with enoxaparin, was associated with lower rates of venous thromboembolism, without increased bleeding.

Cytochromes P450 are members of a superfamily of hemoproteins that catalyze a variety of oxidative reactions in the metabolism of endogenous and exogenous hydrophobic substrates. Fifty-eight cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes belonging to 18 families have been identified in human cells; the corresponding genes are highly polymorphic, and genetic variability underlies interindividual differences in drug response. The polymorphisms of CYP2D6 significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of about 50% of the drugs in clinical use, which are CYP2D6 substrates. The number of functional CYP2D6 alleles per genome determines the existence of four different phenotypes, i.e. poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. CYP2D6 genetic variants include copy number variations, single nucleotide substitutions, frameshift and insertion/deletion mutations. This review reports some of the different methodological approaches used to screen for CYP2D6 variants and focuses on methods that have improved variation detection, from conventional techniques to more recent microarray technology and high throughput DNA sequencing. In addition, this review reports some results on clinical relevance of CYP2D6 polymorphisms and provides examples of variability in drug response associated with interindividual phenotypic differences.",nocancer"Pediatric dental care: prevention and management protocols based on caries risk assessment.

BACKGROUND: After the first monovalent 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccine became available in September 2009, Chinese officials conducted a mass vaccination program in Beijing. We evaluated the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. METHODS: During a 5-day period in September 2009, a total of 95,244 children and adults received the PANFLU.1 vaccine (Sinovac Biotech), a monovalent split-virion vaccine of 15 mug of hemagglutinin antigen without adjuvant. We assessed adverse events after immunization through an enhanced passive-surveillance system and through active surveillance, using diary cards and telephone interviews. Active surveillance for neurologic diseases was implemented in hospitals citywide. To assess vaccine effectiveness, we compared the rates of reported laboratory-confirmed cases of 2009 H1N1 virus infection in students who received the vaccine with the rates in those who did not receive the vaccine, starting 2 weeks after the mass vaccination. RESULTS: As of December 31, 2009, adverse events were reported by 193 vaccine recipients. Through hospital-based active surveillance, 362 cases of incident neurologic diseases were identified within 10 weeks after the mass vaccination, including 27 cases of the Guillain-Barre syndrome. None of the neurologic conditions occurred among vaccine recipients. From 245 schools, 25,037 students participated in the mass vaccination and 244,091 did not. During the period from October 9 through November 15, 2009, the incidence of confirmed cases of 2009 H1N1 virus infection per 100,000 students was 35.9 (9 of 25,037) among vaccinated students and 281.4 (687 of 244,091) among unvaccinated students. Thus, the estimated vaccine effectiveness was 87.3% (95% confidence interval, 75.4 to 93.4). CONCLUSIONS: Among 95,244 children and adults in Beijing, the PANFLU.1 vaccine had a safety profile similar to those of seasonal influenza vaccines and appeared to be effective against confirmed H1N1 virus infection in school-age children.

CONTEXT: The clinical syndrome of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is a common diagnosis in older adults presenting with lower extremity pain. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the accuracy of the clinical examination for the diagnosis of the clinical syndrome of LSS. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL searches of articles published from January 1966 to September 2010. STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they contained adequate data on the accuracy of the history and physical examination for diagnosing the clinical syndrome of LSS, using a reference standard of expert opinion with radiographic or anatomic confirmation. DATA EXTRACTION: Two authors independently reviewed each study to determine eligibility, extract data, and appraise levels of evidence. DATA SYNTHESIS: Four studies evaluating 741 patients were identified. Among patients with lower extremity pain, the likelihood of the clinical syndrome of LSS was increased for individuals older than 70 years (likelihood ratio [LR], 2.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.5), and was decreased for those younger than 60 years (LR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.29-0.57). The most useful symptoms for increasing the likelihood of the clinical syndrome of LSS were having no pain when seated (LR, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.9-30), improvement of symptoms when bending forward (LR, 6.4; 95% CI, 4.1-9.9), the presence of bilateral buttock or leg pain (LR, 6.3; 95% CI, 3.1-13), and neurogenic claudication (LR, 3.7; 95% CI, 2.9-4.8). Absence of neurogenic claudication (LR, 0.23; 95% CI, 0.17-0.31) decreased the likelihood of the diagnosis. A wide-based gait (LR, 13; 95% CI, 1.9-95) and abnormal Romberg test result (LR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.4-13) increased the likelihood of the clinical syndrome of LSS. A score of 7 or higher on a diagnostic support tool including history and examination findings increased the likelihood of the clinical syndrome of LSS (LR, 3.3; 95% CI, 2.7-4.0), while a score lower than 7 made the diagnosis much less likely (LR, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.06-0.16). CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of the clinical syndrome of LSS requires the appropriate clinical picture and radiographic findings. Absence of pain when seated and improvement of symptoms when bending forward are the most useful individual findings. Combinations of findings are most useful for identifying patients who are unlikely to have the diagnosis.",nocancer"Effect of a lung protective strategy for organ donors on eligibility and availability of lungs for transplantation: a randomized controlled trial. CONTEXT: Many potential donor lungs deteriorate between the time of brain death and evaluation for transplantation suitability, possibly because of the ventilatory strategy used after brain death. OBJECTIVE: To test whether a lung protective strategy increases the number of lungs available for transplantation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Multicenter randomized controlled trial of patients with beating hearts who were potential organ donors conducted at 12 European intensive care units from September 2004 to May 2009 in the Protective Ventilatory Strategy in Potential Lung Donors Study. Interventions Potential donors were randomized to the conventional ventilatory strategy (with tidal volumes of 10-12 mL/kg of predicted body weight, positive end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] of 3-5 cm H(2)O, apnea tests performed by disconnecting the ventilator, and open circuit for airway suction) or the protective ventilatory strategy (with tidal volumes of 6-8 mL/kg of predicted body weight, PEEP of 8-10 cm H(2)O, apnea tests performed by using continuous positive airway pressure, and closed circuit for airway suction). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The number of organ donors meeting eligibility criteria for harvesting, number of lungs harvested, and 6-month survival of lung transplant recipients. RESULTS: The trial was stopped after enrolling 118 patients (59 in the conventional ventilatory strategy and 59 in the protective ventilatory strategy) because of termination of funding. The number of patients who met lung donor eligibility criteria after the 6-hour observation period was 32 (54%) in the conventional strategy vs 56 (95%) in the protective strategy (difference of 41% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 26.5% to 54.8%]; P <.001). The number of patients in whom lungs were harvested was 16 (27%) in the conventional strategy vs 32 (54%) in the protective strategy (difference of 27% [95% CI, 10.0% to 44.5%]; P = .004). Six-month survival rates did not differ between recipients who received lungs from donors ventilated with the conventional strategy compared with the protective strategy (11/16 [69%] vs 24/32 [75%], respectively; difference of 6% [95% CI, -22% to 32%]). CONCLUSION: Use of a lung protective strategy in potential organ donors with brain death increased the number of eligible and harvested lungs compared with a conventional strategy.

CONTEXT: Data supporting physical activity guidelines to prevent long-term weight gain are sparse, particularly during the period when the highest risk of weight gain occurs. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between habitual activity levels and changes in body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference over 20 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study is a prospective longitudinal study with 20 years of follow-up, 1985-1986 to 2005-2006. Habitual activity was defined as maintaining high, moderate, and low activity levels based on sex-specific tertiles of activity scores at baseline. Participants comprised a population-based multicenter cohort (Chicago, Illinois; Birmingham, Alabama; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Oakland, California) of 3554 men and women aged 18 to 30 years at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Average annual changes in BMI and waist circumference. RESULTS: Over 20 years, maintaining high levels of activity was associated with smaller gains in BMI and waist circumference compared with low activity levels after adjustment for race, baseline BMI, age, education, cigarette smoking status, alcohol use, and energy intake. Men maintaining high activity gained 2.6 fewer kilograms (0.15 BMI units per year; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11-0.18 vs 0.20 in the lower activity group; 95% CI, 0.17-0.23), and women maintaining higher activity gained 6.1 fewer kilograms (0.17 BMI units per year; 95% CI, 0.12-0.21 vs 0.30 in the lower activity group; 95% CI, 0.25-0.34). Men maintaining high activity gained 3.1 fewer centimeters in waist circumference (0.52 cm per year; 95% CI, 0.43-0.61 cm vs 0.67 cm in the lower activity group; 95% CI,0.60-0.75 cm) and women maintaining higher activity gained 3.8 fewer centimeters(0.49 cm per year; 95% CI, 0.39-0.58 cm vs 0.67 cm in the lower activity group; 95% CI, 0.60-0.75 cm) [corrected].

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Of the many foot and ankle conditions affecting older adults, plantar fasciitis (PF) can be especially debilitating when present for many months or years. Chronic PF is an inflammatory condition of the foot that can be detrimental to an individual's functional abilities. Chronic PF significantly impacts older adults since pain associated with PF can cause gait disturbances, difficulty with activities of daily living, and balance impairments and increase the risk of falling. This case report describes the physical therapy examination and subsequent interventions using iontophoresis with dexamethasone and traditional physical therapy in an older adult with chronic PF. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was a 61-year-old woman with a 10-year history of chronic PF in the left foot. Physical therapy interventions focused on pain control, flexibility, bilateral and single leg stance tasks, and a progressive home exercise program. The main intervention for pain control was iontophoresis with 4 mg/mL of dexamethasone. OUTCOMES: After 8 sessions of physical therapy that included 7 interventions using iontophoresis with dexamethasone, the patient demonstrated consistent improvement despite the chronicity of her condition. She reported an overall decrease in pain from 6-7 of 10 to 3 of 10 and no longer required night splints. She demonstrated increased ankle active range of motion in all planes. Her weight-bearing tolerance improved as evidenced by the ability to comfortably walk for up to 2 hours, chase after her grandson, and negotiate the grocery store without increased left foot symptoms. CONCLUSION: Iontophoresis with dexamethasone combined with individualized traditional physical therapy may have contributed to decreased plantar foot pain, increased ankle active range of motion, and improved functional mobility in this older adult with chronic PF.",nocancer"Update on distance and velocity requirements for community ambulation. PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to provide an update to the ambulatory distance requirements for community ambulation and to update gait speed performance and requirements at intersections. METHODS: Distances were measured at 9 types of sites using a rolling measuring device in accordance with the protocol set forth by Lerner-Frankiel and associates. The 9 types of sites were supermarkets, drug stores, banks, department stores, post offices, medical offices, superstores, club warehouses, and hardware stores. Gait speed allotted by crosswalk signals as well as the gait speeds of individuals through crosswalks were recorded. Qualitative observations of the pedestrians' age (older - 65 years; younger < 65 years) and sex were also noted. RESULTS: Distances were measured at 141 different establishments. The shortest mean distance requirement was found in the medical offices at 65.82 (32.28) m. Club warehouses had the longest mean distance requirement at 676.82 (159.36) m. The mean gait speed used by the pedestrians (N = 139) was 1.32 (0.31) m/s while the mean speed necessary as set by the crosswalk signals was 0.49 (0.20) m/s. All of the individuals observed were able to cross the street within the allotted time and with adequate speed. The gait speeds met the normative data established for age and sex as well as data reported for slower older adults and some with incomplete spinal cord injury. CONCLUSIONS: Distance requirements for full community ambulation may need to be increased to 600 m or more. Gait speed requirements at crosswalks in the communities measured are set to accommodate the gait speed capabilities of older pedestrians who attempt crossing at controlled intersections.",nocancer"Concurrent validity and reliability of the maximum step length test in older adults. PURPOSE: This study assessed concurrent validity of the Maximum Step Length (MSL) test as a measure of falls risk and balance-impairment for community-dwelling older adults. A secondary purpose was to determine intra- and interrater reliability and standard error of measurement of the MSL test. METHODS: Thirty-five community-dwelling adults aged 60 or older provided a 12-month falls history. Functional measures included the MSL test, Single Limb Stance Time, Functional Reach test, Timed Up and Go test, and a test of trunk position sense. Pearson correlation coefficient, intraclass correlation coefficient (a coefficient of relative reliability), and standard error of measurement (a measure of absolute reliability) were calculated as indices of concurrent validity and reliability of the MSL test. Minimal detectable change was also calculated; this represents actual change beyond that of measurement error or random variation in stepping performance. RESULTS: Correlations between MSL score and clinical balance measures and self-reported number of falls in the past 12 months ranged from fair to good. Same-day and 1-month intrarater test-retest reliability of the MSL test was excellent. Same-day interrater reliability between 2 raters was also excellent. Measurement error of the MSL test was low. Minimal detectable change for the MSL test at the 95% confidence level was 7.32 inches. CONCLUSION: The MSL test appears to be a valid and reliable measure of balance-impairment and falls risk in older adults. Clinicians should consider incorporating the MSL test into their battery of falls risk assessment tools. Use of this test as a screening measure may reduce the incidence of falls in community-dwelling older adults. Real change in performance requires a difference of more than 7.32 inches between trials; differences less than this should be interpreted as being due to measurement error or random variation in stepping performance.",nocancer"The effect of shoulder immobilization on balance in community-dwelling older adults. PURPOSE: Shoulder immobilization devices are commonly used in the treatment of older adults following proximal humeral fractures. Immobilization of the shoulder may have a negative effect on balance, which could increase risk for falls. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of shoulder immobilization on balance in the community-dwelling older adult population as measured by the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). METHODS: Fifty-three subjects (14 men and 39 women, mean age = 75.4 years) participated in the study. The BBS was administered twice to each participant. Subjects were tested once while wearing a shoulder immobilizer and once without a shoulder immobilizer. The immobilizer positioned the elbow at 90 degrees of flexion and anchored the arm to the trunk. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test was used to evaluate differences in BBS scores. A 2-tailed test was performed with a set at .05. RESULTS: Mean (SD) BBS scores were 53 (4.0) without the immobilizer and 52 (4.7) with the immobilizer. BBS change scores (score with immobilizer minus score without immobilizer) ranged from +1 to -7, with a mean change score of -1.02. The Wilcoxon signed-ranks test indicated a significant difference between paired observations (negative ranks = 29, positive ranks = 6, P < .0001). Balance was impaired (significantly lower BBS scores) when subjects wore the device compared with the testing sessions without the device. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that immobilizing the shoulder may have a negative effect on balance as measured by the BBS. If shoulder immobilization places an individual at greater risk for falls, early balance screening by a physical therapist to determine the appropriateness of a fall prevention program may be indicated.",nocancer"Predictors of balance in young, middle-aged, and late middle-aged women. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationships between physiological variables and balance and the potential predictors of static and dynamic balance in young (n = 30, 18-25 years), middle-aged (n = 26, 35-45 years), and late middle-aged (n = 29, 55-64 years) women. METHODS: Maximal leg strength, hip and ankle flexibility, total and regional body composition, and total and regional bone mineral density were measured. The NeuroCom Balance Master (NeuroCom International, Inc, Clackamas, Oregon) assessed static postural stability (Modified Clinical Test of Sensory Interaction on Balance [MCTSIB], eyes open [EO] on foam; Unilateral Stance [US] eyes open and eyes closed [EC]) and dynamic balance (Tandem Walk [TW] and Step Quick and Turn [SQT]). RESULTS: The youngest group was significantly stronger (P = .001), had greater bone mineral density (P = .001-.028), lower percentage of fat (P = .001), and greater bone-free lean body mass (P = .028 for arms and P = .004 for legs) than the older groups. Hip and ankle flexibility was similar between groups and only 2 measures of balance (US EO and SQT) were significantly different, with the oldest group being significantly less stable than the other 2 groups (P = .001 and P = .018, respectively). Regression analyses determined only 1 significant prediction equation for balance for the youngest group (TW Sway Velocity), 2 significant prediction equations for the middle-aged group (US EC Sway Velocity and SQT Sway), and 5 significant prediction equations for the oldest group (MCTSIB EC Sway Velocity, US EO Sway Velocity, US EC Sway Velocity, TW Sway Velocity, and SQT Sway). CONCLUSION: Measures of balance were easier to predict as age increased, and there were more significant correlations between predictors of balance when balance was assessed dynamically (TW and SQT) rather than statically (MCTSIB and US).",nocancer"Tai chi as a balance improvement exercise for older adults: a systematic review. PURPOSE: The purpose of this systematic review was to identify exercise parameters and the most common outcome measures used in tai chi (TC) research. METHODS: Ovid Medline and PubMed were used to identify longitudinal studies published from January 2000 to July 2007 written in English with the key words tai chi, tai ji, tai chi quan, tai ji quan, balance, falls, and falling. Qualifying studies had subjects aged 60 years or older. RESULTS: In all 19 qualified prospective studies, older vigorous and likely transitional frail individuals seemed to benefit more from TC than did older frail individuals. The most commonly used TC parameters were Yang's style, with 12 or fewer forms, durations of 12 weeks or longer, frequencies of twice a week or more, and session lengths of at least 45 minutes. The most common outcome measures observed were a combination of 2 to 5 of the following 10 measures (from most to least common): fear of falling, single-leg stance, posturography, rate of falling, flexibility, walking velocity, Berg Balance Scale, Timed up and Go, Functional Reach, and ankle and knee joint strength and range of motion. Improvements were reported in almost all of these measures. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates that TC may be an economic and effective exercise program for improving balance and balance confidence in older adults.",nocancer"Surveillance for certain health behaviors among states and selected local areas - United States, 2008. PROBLEM: Chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and stroke) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Data on health risk behaviors that increase the risk for chronic diseases and use of preventive practices are essential for the development, implementation, and evaluation of health promotion programs, policies, and intervention strategies to decrease or prevent the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Surveillance data from states and territories, selected metropolitan and micropolitan areas, and counties are vital components of these various prevention and intervention strategies. REPORTING PERIOD: January-December 2008 Description of the System: The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an ongoing, state-based, random-digit--dialed telephone survey of noninstitutionalized adults residing in the United States. BRFSS collects data on health risk behaviors, preventive health services and practices, and access to health care related to the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. This report presents results for 2008 for all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands, 177 metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (MMSAs), and 266 counties.

Adults aged >/=45 years with a history of stroke: 3% to 7% for states and territories, 2% to 11% for selected MMSAs, and 1% to 12% for counties. INTERPRETATION: The findings in this report indicate substantial variation in health-risk behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, and use of preventive health-care services among U.S. adults at the state and territory, MMSA, and county level. The findings underscore the continued need for surveillance of health-risk behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, and the use of preventive health services. PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION: Healthy People 2010 objectives have been established to monitor health behaviors and the use of preventive health services. Local and state health departments and federal agencies use BRFSS data to identify populations at high risk for certain health behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, and to evaluate the use of preventive services. In addition, BRFSS data are used to direct, implement, monitor, and evaluate public health programs and policies that can lead to a reduction in morbidity and mortality from adverse effects of health-risk behaviors and subsequent chronic conditions.",nocancer"Prevention of pneumococcal disease among infants and children - use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine - recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). On February 24, 2010, a 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide-protein conjugate vaccine (PCV13 [Prevnar 13, Wyeth Pharmaceuticals Inc., marketed by Pfizer Inc.]) was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused among infants and young children by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes covered by the vaccine and for prevention of otitis media caused by serotypes also covered by the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine formulation (PCV7 [Prevnar, Wyeth]). PCV13 contains the seven serotypes included in PCV7 (serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) and six additional serotypes (serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A). PCV13 is approved for use among children aged 6 weeks-71 months and supersedes PCV7, which was licensed by FDA in 2000. This report summarizes recommendations approved by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on February 24, 2010, for the use of PCV13 to prevent pneumococcal disease in infants and young children aged <6 years. Recommendations include 1) routine vaccination of all children aged 2-59 months, 2) vaccination of children aged 60-71 months with underlying medical conditions, and 3) vaccination of children who received >/=1 dose of PCV7 previously (CDC. Licensure of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV13] and recommendations for use among children-Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP], 2010. MMWR 2010;59:258-61). Recommendations also are provided for targeted use of the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23, formerly PPV23) in children aged 2-18 years with underlying medical conditions that increase their risk for contracting pneumococcal disease or experiencing complications of pneumococcal disease if infected. The ACIP recommendation for routine vaccination with PCV13 and the immunization schedules for children aged </=59 months who have not received any previous PCV7 or PCV13 doses are the same as those published previously for PCV7 (CDC. Preventing pneumococcal disease among infants and young children: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP]. MMWR 2000;49[No. RR-9]; CDC. Updated recommendation from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [ACIP] for use of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV7] in children aged 24-59 months who are not completely vaccinated. MMWR 2008;57:343-4), with PCV13 replacing PCV7 for all doses. For routine immunization of infants, PCV13 is recommended as a 4-dose series at ages 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months. Infants and children who have received >/=1 dose of PCV7 should complete the immunization series with PCV13. A single supplemental dose of PCV13 is recommended for all children aged 14-59 months who have received 4 doses of PCV7 or another age-appropriate, complete PCV7 schedule. For children who have underlying medical conditions, a supplemental PCV13 dose is recommended through age 71 months. Children aged 2-18 years with underlying medical conditions also should receive PPSV23 after completing all recommended doses of PCV13.",nocancer"Update: outbreak of cholera ---Haiti, 2010. The first cholera outbreak in Haiti in at least a century was confirmed by the Haitian National Public Health Laboratory on October 21, 2010. Surveillance data through December 3, provided by the Haitian Ministry of Public Health and Population (MSPP), indicated that the outbreak had spread nationwide and that cases of cholera and cholera-associated hospitalizations and deaths had climbed rapidly in November. As of December 3, MSPP reported 91,770 cases of cholera from all 10 departments and the capital city of Port-au-Prince; 43,243 (47.1%) patients had been hospitalized, and 2,071 (2.3%) had died. A rapid mortality assessment in Artibonite Department found that deaths occurred as rapidly as 2 hours after symptom onset and identified important gaps in access to life-saving treatments, including oral rehydration solution (ORS). Urgent activities are under way, and additional efforts are imperative to reduce cholera mortality by expanding access to cholera treatment and to reduce cholera transmission by improving access to safe water and adequate sanitation.",nocancer"Progress toward poliomyelitis eradication --- India, January 2009-October 2010. India is one of only four countries (including Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan) where wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission has never been interrupted. Historically, WPV transmission in India has centered largely in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, two states with low routine vaccination coverage, large migrant and remote populations, and lower relative vaccine effectiveness than other areas of the country. However, during a 9-month period from November 2009 to August 2010, no WPV type 1 (WPV1) cases were reported in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar. This report summarizes the substantial progress made in India toward polio eradication during January 2009-October 2010, according to data reported as of December 4, and updates previous reports. During January-October 2010, only 40 WPV cases were confirmed in India, a 94% decrease from the 626 WPV cases confirmed during the same period in 2009; the decrease likely resulted, in large part, from the introduction of bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine types 1 and 3 (bOPV). Increasingly important contributors to WPV transmission are large migrant subpopulations; surveys have indicated that up to 11% of children aged <5 years in these subpopulations were missed during supplementary immunization activities (SIAs). Interruption of all WPV transmission in India will require maintaining high levels of immunity in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and additional efforts directed toward children in migrant subpopulations that are not vaccinated as readily during SIAs.",nocancer"Nonpolio enterovirus and human parechovirus surveillance --- United States, 2006-2008. Enteroviruses, members of the Picornaviridae family, are common viruses associated with clinical manifestations ranging from mild respiratory symptoms to serious conditions, including aseptic meningitis, encephalitis, neonatal sepsis, and acute flaccid paralysis. Approximately 100 serotypes of nonpolio enteroviruses have been recognized, and some viruses previously classified as enteroviruses, namely echovirus 22 and 23, recently have been reclassified as human parechoviruses (HPeVs), a different genus within the Picornaviridae family. This report describes trends in nonpolio enterovirus and HPeV detections during 2006-2008, based on data from two laboratory-based surveillance systems, the National Enterovirus Surveillance System (NESS) and, for the first time, the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS). As in previous years, approximately 70% of detections occurred during July-October, the peak enterovirus season. The five most common enterovirus serotypes (coxsackievirus B1 [CVB1], echovirus 6, echovirus 9, echovirus 18, and coxsackievirus A9) accounted for 54% of total serotyped detections. During 2006-2008, southern states reported the most serotyped enterovirus detections, followed by midwestern states, western states, and the northeastern states. In 2007 and 2008, CVB1 was the predominant serotype detected, accounting for 24% and 19% of overall detections, respectively. In 2007, CVB1 was implicated in an outbreak of serious neonatal infections in the United States. Understanding trends in enterovirus and HPeV circulation can help clinicians decide when to test for these infections. Also, more timely reporting of data could help public health officials recognize outbreaks associated with these viruses.",nocancer"Human paragonimiasis after eating raw or undercooked crayfish --- Missouri, July 2006-September 2010. Paragonimiasis is a parasitic disease caused by Paragonimus trematodes, commonly known as lung flukes. Humans become infected by eating raw or undercooked crayfish (also known as crawfish and crawdads) or freshwater crabs that harbor the parasites. Paragonimiasis most frequently involves the lungs, but can affect other organs, including the brain and skin. In North America, Paragonimus kellicotti causes infections among dogs, cats, and wild carnivores, but rarely infects humans. Paragonimiasis is not a nationally notifiable condition. In September 2009, physicians from the Washington University School of Medicine (WUSM) in St. Louis published details of three paragonimiasis cases diagnosed since July 2006 in persons who had eaten raw crayfish from rivers in Missouri, prompting the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services (MDHSS), CDC, and WUSM to collaborate in paragonimiasis surveillance and prevention. During September 2009-September 2010, six additional cases were diagnosed in Missouri. These nine patients, aged 10-32 years, had fever, cough, pleural effusion, and eosinophilia. All had eaten raw or undercooked crayfish from rivers in Missouri while on canoeing or camping trips within 4 months of illness onset. Health-care providers should consider paragonimiasis when examining patients with unexplained fever, cough, eosinophilia, and pleural effusion or other chest radiographic abnormalities and should ask those patients whether they have eaten raw or undercooked crayfish.",nocancer"Thought for food: imagined consumption reduces actual consumption. The consumption of a food typically leads to a decrease in its subsequent intake through habituation--a decrease in one's responsiveness to the food and motivation to obtain it. We demonstrated that habituation to a food item can occur even when its consumption is merely imagined. Five experiments showed that people who repeatedly imagined eating a food (such as cheese) many times subsequently consumed less of the imagined food than did people who repeatedly imagined eating that food fewer times, imagined eating a different food (such as candy), or did not imagine eating a food. They did so because they desired to eat it less, not because they considered it less palatable. These results suggest that mental representation alone can engender habituation to a stimulus.",nocancer"Neonatal abstinence syndrome after methadone or buprenorphine exposure. BACKGROUND: Methadone, a full mu-opioid agonist, is the recommended treatment for opioid dependence during pregnancy. However, prenatal exposure to methadone is associated with a neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) characterized by central nervous system hyperirritability and autonomic nervous system dysfunction, which often requires medication and extended hospitalization. Buprenorphine, a partial mu-opioid agonist, is an alternative treatment for opioid dependence but has not been extensively studied in pregnancy. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, double-dummy, flexible-dosing, randomized, controlled study in which buprenorphine and methadone were compared for use in the comprehensive care of 175 pregnant women with opioid dependency at eight international sites. Primary outcomes were the number of neonates requiring treatment for NAS, the peak NAS score, the total amount of morphine needed to treat NAS, the length of the hospital stay for neonates, and neonatal head circumference. RESULTS: Treatment was discontinued by 16 of the 89 women in the methadone group (18%) and 28 of the 86 women in the buprenorphine group (33%). A comparison of the 131 neonates whose mothers were followed to the end of pregnancy according to treatment group (with 58 exposed to buprenorphine and 73 exposed to methadone) showed that the former group required significantly less morphine (mean dose, 1.1 mg vs. 10.4 mg; P<0.0091), had a significantly shorter hospital stay (10.0 days vs. 17.5 days, P<0.0091), and had a significantly shorter duration of treatment for the neonatal abstinence syndrome (4.1 days vs. 9.9 days, P<0.003125) (P values calculated in accordance with prespecified thresholds for significance). There were no significant differences between groups in other primary or secondary outcomes or in the rates of maternal or neonatal adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the use of buprenorphine as an acceptable treatment for opioid dependence in pregnant women.

The author describes how her own internal change was a vital part of transformation between herself and two patients. She draws on Loewald's work as she discusses how change in her own internal relationship with her father was part of a lifelong emotional reorganization of Oedipal relations. She describes a process of mutual change whereby her and her patients' unconscious growth each stimulated the other. She suggests that the analyst's own emotional growth is a vital, not an incidental, part of psychoanalysis, as it brings new life to the work for patients as well as analysts themselves.",nocancer"Inherent contradictions in the ego ideal. The author puts forth a concept of the ego ideal as the fantasied self that the child believes will bring it gratification and happiness. He then shows how the ego ideal's content evolves through the various stages of psychosexual development in accordance with its mission. A picture emerges of an ego ideal in inherent conflict because it is shaped by contradictory wishes, as well as contradictory fantasies of how to make those wishes come true. A section on romantic love points to a second contradiction within the ego ideal, beyond its contradictory content: a contradiction of aim.",nocancer"Neediness and narcissistic defensive action. Action-prone patients are difficult for most analysts to treat. The author describes patients who act in treatment by pressuring themselves and the analyst to get rid of what is wrong, to change the imperative, life-and-death qualities of need into something else. Viewing neediness in treatment as narcissistic defensive action helps the analyst address the patient's pressured flight away from focusing on the need of the analyst and toward action aimed at riddance. Ghent's (1992, 1993) views on neediness are discussed and seen to be complemented by a view of action as protection against narcissistic vulnerability. Analysts' intolerance, vulnerabilities, and needs with such patients are considered.",nocancer"The traumatic roots of containment: the evolution of Bion's metapsychology. W. R. Bion wrote repeatedly about his World War I experiences as a tank officer, thus engaging in historicizing a traumatic emotional experience. A close reading of the many layers in these writings suggests that the war experiences influenced the metapsychology he created. The author argues that haunting questions regarding the ability of the mind to survive trauma led Bion to elaborate on the process of containing emotional experience, and hence to address the lack of an intricate theory of thinking in psychoanalytic metapsychology and to offer a vision of a mind struggling to survive, culminating in the growth of a postmodern consciousness.",nocancer"The Kore complex: on a woman's inheritance of her mother's failed Oedipus complex. The Greek myth of Kore/Persephone captures a particular psychopathology of women who are torn between a deadened and often asexual husband (Hades) and an ongoing close relationship with a caretaking mother (Demeter). Psychoanalytic work often reveals that these women live in the shadow of their mothers' failed oedipal complex. Their identificatory preoccupation with maternal object preservation disrupted or distorted their oedipal development, and ever since continues to serve as a defense against sexual strivings. Thus, these women are trapped in a Kore complex: as maiden caretakers, they remain attached to and torn between a ""grain mother"" and a grandfather transference object.",nocancer"The body emerging from the ""neverland"" of nothingness. The author considers sensory perceptions arising from the body to be the first expressions of self-consciousness and mental existence in patients who are overwhelmed by a dimensionless abyss of nothingness. This perspective can help the analyst in catalyzing the patient's integration with his deepest levels of mental functioning. Clinical material from the four-session-per-week analysis of a psychotic patient is discussed. To this analysis and, finding the body meant finding ""the land that never was,"" a ""land"" that could begin to exist in analysis thanks to a relational working through within the analytic couple.",nocancer"Urban transitions: on urban resilience and human-dominated ecosystems. Urbanization is a global multidimensional process paired with increasing uncertainty due to climate change, migration of people, and changes in the capacity to sustain ecosystem services. This article lays a foundation for discussing transitions in urban governance, which enable cities to navigate change, build capacity to withstand shocks, and use experimentation and innovation in face of uncertainty. Using the three concrete case cities--New Orleans, Cape Town, and Phoenix--the article analyzes thresholds and cross-scale interactions, and expands the scale at which urban resilience has been discussed by integrating the idea from geography that cities form part of ""system of cities"" (i.e., they cannot be seen as single entities). Based on this, the article argues that urban governance need to harness social networks of urban innovation to sustain ecosystem services, while nurturing discourses that situate the city as part of regional ecosystems. The article broadens the discussion on urban resilience while challenging resilience theory when addressing human-dominated ecosystems. Practical examples of harnessing urban innovation are presented, paired with an agenda for research and policy.",nocancer"Physically and sexually violent experiences of reproductive-aged women displaced by Hurricane Katrina. PURPOSE: Measure the frequency of physical and sexual abuse in a sample of reproductive aged women displaced by Hurricane Katrina, and compare those experiences to the year before Hurricane Katrina. METHODS: Sixty-six English-speaking women aged 18-49 years residing in Louisiana Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) housing were screened for physical and sexual abuse seven to nine months after Hurricane Katrina, using modified 30x7 cluster sampling methodology. FINDINGS: Twenty-three percent (95% confidence interval [CI], 14, 34%) of women reported being hit or verbally threatened since Hurricane Katrina. Abuse had increased for 33% (95% CI, 13, 63%) and decreased for 13% (95% CI, 4, 37%) of women. Twenty percent (95% CI, 6, 51%) of abused women were with a new partner, while 13% (95% CI, 4, 39%) reported new abuse with the same partner. Four women reported sexual abuse since Hurricane Katrina. Compared to before the storm, the frequency of sexual abuse was the same for two women, and one reported new abuse with the same partner. CONCLUSIONS: Physical abuse was not uncommon among displaced women following Hurricane Katrina. Increasing and new abuse were the most commonly reported experiences. Violence against women should not be overlooked as a continued, and perhaps escalating, occurrence requiring attention following displacement after disasters of such magnitude as Hurricane Katrina.",nocancer"Coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms, the LSUHSC-S experience. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated and compared patient selection and outcome statistics during the first 18 months of the Louisiana State Health Sciences Center-Shreveport (LSUHSC-S) neurointerventional suite operation, specifically focusing on endovascular occlusion of intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 67 patients with 68 cerebral aneurysms that were treated at the LSUHSC-S from July 2006 to December 2007 was conducted. All procedures were performed with the patients under general anesthesia and with systemic heparinization using live simultaneous roadmapping. The presence of residual aneurysmal filling was determined at the end of each procedure. RESULTS: A total of 67 patients underwent 70 endovascular coil embolization procedures for 68 intracranial aneurysms. Mean age of the patients was 51 years (range 15-89 years). There was a slight female preponderance (58.2% vs 41.8%). The vast majority of aneurysms undergoing coil embolization had ruptured (83.8%). Most were located in anterior circulation and (77.9%) were small (< 10 mm) in size (91.2%). Endovascular remodeling was attempted in 21 procedures (30%). Following embolization, complications were observed in 20 cases (28.6%). Though a greater proportion of complications occurred following procedures involving the posterior circulation, there was no statistical significance (p = 0.126, Chi-Square). Complete post-embolization occlusion was achieved with 33 aneurysms (47%). Near complete occlusion (> 90%) was seen in 65 (91.4%). There was no statistical association between location of the aneurysm and incomplete post procedure occlusion (p = 0.794, Chi-square). CONCLUSION: Our experience with coil embolization of intracranial aneurysms shows encouraging results and mirrors published rates of immediate post procedures near complete occlusion rates of approximately 90%.",nocancer"The impact of auto-enrollment and automatic contribution escalation on retirement income adequacy. The results in this paper demonstrate the profound influence of plan design variables, as well as assumptions of employee behavior in auto-enrollment 401(k) plans. Even with a relatively simple definition of ""success,"" large differences in success rates can be seen, depending on which plan design factors and employee behavior assumptions are used: The probability of success for the lowest-income quartile increases from the baseline probability of 45.7 percent to 79.2 percent when all four factors are applied. The impact on the highest-income quartile is even more impressive, with an increase in the probability of success from 27.0 percent to 64.0 percent. When viewed in isolation, it is clear that the impact of increasing the limit on employee contributions is much greater than any of the other three factors. However, the importance of including one or more additional factors, along with the increase in the limit on employee contributions, can more than double the impact of increasing the limit by itself. This suggests that additional analysis of the influence of plan design variables on optimizing employee results is warranted. The next step in this project will include development of a plan-specific simulation model that will allow additional plan design variables.",nocancer"The effect of skin conditions on patients' quality of life. Skin conditions can adversely affect many aspects of patients' lives. The quality of life for people with skin conditions such as psoriasis, atopic eczema and acne can be significantly impaired in terms of their psychological wellbeing, social functioning and everyday activities. The significant psychological and social morbidity that occurs in patients with common skin conditions may go unrecognised without appropriate assessment.

Epidural analgesia is a common technique used to manage acute pain after major surgery and is viewed as the 'gold standard'. When managed effectively, epidural analgesia is known to reduce the risk of adverse outcomes following major surgery. There are two main classes of medications used in epidural analgesia: opioids and local anaesthetics. Both of these drugs are beneficial in reducing or eliminating pain, but are also responsible for the common side effects associated with this method of pain relief. There are also some rare and potentially fatal side effects of epidural therapy. The nurse's role is to assess and monitor patients carefully and report and respond to any concerns.",nocancer"Attitudes of first-year physician assistant students towards older adults. PURPOSE: research has established that attitudes can influence behavior. However, there is little information on physician assistant (PA) students' attitudes towards older adults. Research conducted on medical students has often revealed negative attitudes and little interest in geriatrics. This study investigates the attitudes of first-year PA students regarding older adults and provides data on this underdeveloped area in the literature. METHODS: first-year PA students at Western Michigan University were invited to participate in a study that involved responding to two questionnaires: a modified version of Polizzi's 2003 Aging Semantic Differential (ASD), using men and women aged 70 to 85 as the target population, and a survey consisting of custom-made, fill-in, Likert-scale questions regarding relationships and contact with older adults. RESULTS: the mean ASD score of 2.53 indicated a mildly positive attitude towards the target population. The only significant association found through regression analyses was that students with weekly socialization with older adults had more positive attitudes towards them than did the students with yearly socialization. CONCLUSIONS: the direct and significant association of frequency of socialization with positive attitude towards older adults is consistent with similar research on first-year medical students. Some medical schools have implemented strategies of intentional socialization between their students and older adults to improve the students' attitudes. PA programs may want to further assess their students' attitudes to older adults and implement interventions to improve them, where indicated. Additionally, several questions for additional research are suggested from this study.",nocancer"The physician assistant teaching fellowship: A model for faculty recruitment. PURPOSE: the rapid growth of the number of physician assistant (PA) programs in the last two decades has resulted in a heightened demand for qualified and experienced PA faculty. Barriers to recruitment and retention of faculty include the need for diverse teaching experiences and the lack of available mentors. METHODS: in order to provide a structured experience for training potential faculty for careers as PA educators and to address the barriers to recruitment and retention of new faculty, our institution has offered a PA teaching fellowship since 1998. RESULTS: the teaching fellowship has met its goal of increasing the pool of qualified PA faculty, as nine of the 11 graduates were hired full-time into PA teaching and program administration positions. Curriculum projects developed by the fellows have been incorporated into our curriculum and have been shared with other PA programs. CONCLUSIONS: the PA teaching fellowship is a valuable strategy for developing teaching skills, promoting professionalism among PA educators, increasing the pool of available and qualified PA faculty, and overcoming barriers to retention. This model may be useful to other institutions.",nocancer"Oral health curricula in physician assistant programs: a survey of physician assistant program directors. PURPOSE: a review of the medical literature indicates that physician assistants (PAs) are not educationally prepared for oral health issues. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the status of oral health curricula and the knowledge and skills taught within PA curricula. METHODS: a survey examining oral health curricula in PA education was distributed electronically to the directors of all 142 accredited PA programs in the United States. The survey focused on aspects of oral health that programs currently teach and aspects that merit future inclusion. The survey data were analyzed using SPSS version 17. RESULTS: eighty-three of the 142 PA program directors (58.4%) responded to the survey. Over 74% believed that dental disease prevention should be addressed in PA education, yet only 21% of programs actually did so. Most respondents (94.7%) also agreed that PAs should routinely assess and screen for early signs of dental disease and counsel patients on preventing dental problems. Currently, over half of PA programs teach examination of children's teeth for cavities (55.6%), dedicating on average 3.6 hours toward oral health education. Most respondents (more than 90%) expressed a desire to implement an oral health module in their programs. On average, program directors felt that 5.3 hours should be dedicated to oral health. CONCLUSION: many PA program directors believe that PA programs are responsible for educating students about oral health; however, most PA program directors report a lack of oral health education within their curricula.",nocancer"Relationships of demographic background and practice setting among practicing physician assistants in the United States. INTRODUCTION: it is assumed that minority health care providers continue to work in primary care and in underserved areas in higher proportions than their nonminority counterparts, regardless of changing workforce practice patterns. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether this assumption still holds true among US physician assistants (PAs) in light of recent PA specialization. This assumption is important as there is continuing evidence that a similar background between providers and patients can be beneficial to the provider-patient relationship and to patient outcomes. A secondary purpose was to determine the relationships between various demographic variables (eg, race) and current practice specialty and population served among all PAs. METHODS: this cross-sectional study measured demographic and practice setting survey data. A random sample of 10,500 PAs was surveyed. RESULTS: the main finding was that minority PAs were more likely to care for the underserved (31.9% vs. 19.3%) and to work in primary care practices (38.8% vs. 29.3%) than were nonminorities. A significant relationship was also found between serving underserved populations and nonmarried status, as well as age over 39 (these groups were more likely to serve this population, p < 0.01). Household income less than $50,000 at the time of high school graduation was significantly related to caring for underserved individuals (p < 0.01) and working in primary care settings (more likely to serve in these settings, p 0.001). Conclusions: Minority PAs were more likely to care for the underserved and work in primary care settings. Certain other demographic variables among all respondents were also significantly related to service to the underserved and work in primary care settings.",nocancer"Simulation-based examinations in physician assistant education: A comparison of two standard-setting methods. PURPOSE: this study explored the reliability of two simple standard-setting methods that are used to set passing standards for a standardized patient (SP) exam in physician assistant (PA) education. METHODS: fifty-four second-year PA students participated in a multistation SP-based clinical skills exam. Cut scores were set using the Angoff and Borderline Group methods. A panel of PA faculty set cut scores using the Angoff method. A modified version of the Borderline Group method set cut scores using SP global ratings verified by faculty review. Inter-rater reliability between judges was evaluated using kappa coefficient (k) for the Angoff method and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the Borderline Group method. RESULTS: the Borderline Group method set an overall cut score for the exam of 76% (95% CI +/- 5) and the Angoff method set a cut score at 62% (95% CI +/- 9). Both methods demonstrated sufficient inter-rater reliability (k 0.60, ICC > 0.70; both significant at p < 0.05), although one case (preop history and physical) demonstrated poor inter-rater reliability between judges using the Borderline Group method. DISCUSSION: the Borderline Group method offered a slightly more reliable cut score when compared to the standard set by the Angoff method, but was more challenging to implement. In addition, one case demonstrated poor inter-rater reliability with the Borderline Group method. Using SPs to complete global borderline ratings offers one solution to make the Borderline Group method more feasibile, but requires a high degree of initial rater calibration and periodic measures of interrater reliability between faculty and SPs.",nocancer"Grandparenting: diversity in grandparent experiences and needs for healthcare and support.

The purpose of this study was to determine graduating dental students' perceptions about their training and experience in examination and treatment of infants and their plans to examine infants upon graduation. A survey was distributed to dental students graduating from Pennsylvania dental schools in 2007 and 2008. Of the returned surveys, 47.9 percent correctly identified 12 months as the recommended age for the first dental exam. Sixty-five percent of responders felt they would be comfortable performing exams on young children. This study's primary objective was to test the association between performance of a clinical exam in a young child, enjoyment of clinical and didactic pediatric dental experience, plans for additional training in pediatric dentistry and willingness to see children younger than two years old in practice. Performing a clinical exam on a young child was associated to willingness to see children younger than two years of age in practice. Early exposure (lecture or clinical) to young pediatric patients while in dental school was significantly associated to perceived comfort with oral exam of young patients but not to reported willingness to see them in practice.",nocancer"Diagnosis, management, and pathogenesis of TTP/HUS in an HIV positive patient.

At the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services laboratory, clinical laboratory scientists receive specimens from various health care facilities and clinics in the state, and identify and confirm organisms of particular health concern in a rapid and timely manner. Most of the assays performed are specialized tests that are not done routinely in the clinical laboratories. Identifying and monitoring infectious agents such as West Nile virus, Influenza 2009 A (H1N1) pdm, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, enteric organisms, etc. is part of the daily workload in the Public Health Laboratories. In addition, surveillance programs are in place to control the spread of various infectious agents and to aid in investigative epidemiologic purposes. The volume of samples and workload demands can be overwhelming especially in peak months such as summer (WNV) or winter (Influenza A) therefore, it was necessary to implement molecular diagnostics and robotic technology to aid in high throughput analysis.

As one can see by the tests listed at www.amp.org, molecular diagnostic techniques have enabled the laboratory professionals to play an integral role in the identification and quantitation of viral infectious agents. Viral loads can be determined for HIV, HBV, and HCV using a variety of molecular methods such as real-time PCR, TMA, NASBA, and bDNA. Determining the amount of viral particles in a sample can not only monitor the status and progression of the disease, but can also guide recommendations for antiviral therapy. Other assays listed include cytomegalovirus, enterovirus, and human metapneumovirus detection, HPV testing, influenza and respiratory virus panels, and West Nile virus detection in blood donations using a variety of molecular methodologies. The use of molecular methodologies in the detection of viral pathogens has grown at an astounding rate, especially in the past two decades. It is now widely accepted that PCR is the ""gold standard"" for nucleic acid detection in the clinical laboratory as well as in research facilities. This article only touched on some of the common, widely used assays and platforms used in the identification process. With more and more assays being developed, the cost behind molecular testing has decreased since there are more competitors on the market. At one point, laboratorians may have thought of routine molecular testing as the wave of the future. It is obvious the future is upon us. Molecular diagnostics has become part of the daily, routine workload in most clinical laboratories. The advent of fully automated systems with faster turn around times has given laboratory professionals the tools necessary to report out accurate and sensitive results to clinicians who can ultimately improve patient care and outcomes by rendering a correct and rapid diagnosis.",nocancer"C-reactive protein levels are elevated in asthma and asthma-like conditions. OBJECTIVE: Asthma is a chronic disease involving airway hyperresponsiveness. It was proposed that asthma/chronic shortness of breath elicit chronic systemic inflammation even in the absence of episodic events. DESIGN: Volunteers completed questionnaires relevant to asthma and/or dyspnea and consented to C-reactive protein (CRP) quantitation. Subject groups were: control (no reported dyspnea) and asthma/shortness of breath [dyspnea] group. SETTING: Studies were performed in the Saint Louis metropolitan area. PARTICIPANTS: Participants consisted of volunteers aged 18-57. Inclusion criteria were good health, not pregnant, weight > 110 pounds and absence of antiinflammatory medicine use. RESULTS: Serum CRP ranged from undetectable to 22,013 ng/mL. Mean results for asthmatic/dyspnea (n = 22) and control (n = 27) groups were 4,203 +/- 1,323 ng/mL and 1,741 +/- 467 ng/mL (p < 0.05) respectively.

OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the quality of trauma specimens by comparing line draws to venipuncture. DESIGN: The draw type (line or venipuncture); container type (Vacutainer or Microtainer); and suitability for processing (processed/hemolyzed/clotted) of routinely collected trauma specimens was analyzed. SETTING: The clinical laboratory of a Level I Pediatric Trauma Center. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Hemolyzed trauma specimens were analyzed according to method of collection, collector, and type of container to identify issues resulting in unusable samples. RESULTS: The data shows that for 13% of all draws, portions of the results were affected by hemolysis. Sixteen percent of line draws and 6% of venipunctures were hemolyzed (p = 0.04). There was no statistical association with who collected the sample (p = 0.07) or type of container (p = 1.00). CONCLUSION: Based on this sample of data, the laboratory recommends that, whenever possible, venipunctures be performed for laboratory testing of blood specimens to improve trauma specimen integrity.",nocancer"Patient safety and quality improvement: a policy assessment. BACKGROUND: The regulation implementing the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (PSQIA) was published on November 21, 2008, and became effective on January 19, 2009 (42 C.F.R. Part 3). PSQIA establishes a voluntary reporting system to enhance the data available to assess and resolve patient safety and health care quality issues. To encourage the reporting and analysis of medical errors, PSQIA provides federal privilege and confidentiality protections for patient safety information. PURPOSE: Greater reporting and analysis of patient safety events will yield increased data and better understanding of patient safety events. A PSO's workforce must have expertise in analyzing patient safety events, such as the identification, analysis, prevention, and reduction or elimination of the risks and hazards associated with the delivery of patient care. IMPLICATIONS: This new legislation provides a vehicle to better understand at a macro level how the clinical laboratory threatens patient safety and how that threat can be better controlled. What is imperative is that the clinical laboratory staff be involved in collecting and analyzing data. If they are not, the probability is high that data being reported by the laboratory will be misunderstood at the PSO and laboratories may be cited as a threat to patient safety because of a lack of understanding of laboratory operations.",nocancer"Blended courses: the best of online and traditional formats.

Urinary incontinence (UI) frequently occurs after stroke and often remains an extensive problem for these patients and their relatives even after discharge from the hospital. Therapeutic interventions, such as behavioral training, can help manage UI. Recently, a multimodal application of nursing interventions was recommended (Wilbert-Herr, Hurlimann, Imhof & Wilbert, 2006). The primary goals of the study discussed in this article were to introduce therapeutic interventions of UI management into clinical rehabilitation practice based on a structured process of interdisciplinary caregiving and test the treatment effect. Forty-four patients who had suffered a cerebrovascular accident (CVA) were included in the study. Nursing interventions included distinction of stress or urge UI and the assessment of different forms of UI. The latter intervention was based on the functional independence measure (FIM Item G-bladder management), the protocol of micturition, urine dipstick, and ultrasound measurement of post-void residual urine (PVR). Interventions were applied according to the recommendations of the 3rd International Consultation on Incontinence. An algorithm of the interdisciplinary process was implemented, and the nursing staff received specific education regarding the interventions. Twenty-one (47%) of the patients in the study were diagnosed with UI; 67% of these patients achieved the targeted level of continence by individually tailored interventions, which consisted of a systematic nursing assessment and standards for prompted voiding, timed voiding, and habit training. Planned processes, including screening procedures, assessment, profile of continence, intervention, and education and evaluation, increase the likelihood of positive results of rehabilitation of patients after CVA. Additional intervention studies are suggested to investigate the effectiveness of the algorithm used in this study.",nocancer"Addressing the need for research on bariatric patient. During the past 3 decades numerous studies have documented the high prevalence of patient handling-related musculoskeletal injuries among healthcare workers and evaluated ergonomic interventions using mechanized equipment for lifting and moving patients. A great deal of research-based evidence now demonstrates the effectiveness of ergonomic interventions to reduce injury risk among healthcare workers who handle patients of average weights and sizes. In contrast, there is a lack of evidence-based research that evaluates ergonomic interventions for handling bariatric patients, whose extreme weights and sizes necessitate specialized handling equipment. The obesity epidemic, along with special medical and therapeutic concerns regarding bariatric patients, exacerbates healthcare workers' patient handling demands. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health is conducting a new study to evaluate bariatric patient handling hazards and interventions and identify evidence-based best practices for handling this population.",nocancer"Emergencies, disasters, and catastrophic events: the role of rehabilitation nurses in preparedness, response, and recovery. Rehabilitation nurses play an integral role in helping patients and communities plan for, respond to, and recover from disasters. This article provides an overview of various types of disasters, the terminology used by planners and responders, and the structure that governs the delivery of services, resources, and patient care. Information about specialized training in disaster response and volunteer opportunities through national and state humanitarian relief programs are provided. Although each nursing specialty lends expertise to emergency and disaster situations, rehabilitation nurses are particularly well-suited to help during times of complex, multifaceted medical and emotional responses.",nocancer"Developing evidence-based interventions to address the leading causes of workers' compensation among healthcare workers. Overexertion and slip, trip, and fall (STF) incidents are two of the leading sources of workers'compensation claims and costs in healthcare settings (Bell et al., 2008; Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2008). Working in conjunction with a team of international researchers, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has been conducting research to demonstrate the effectiveness of comprehensive safe patient handling and STF-prevention programs. The purpose of this article is to summarize the research and outreach efforts of NIOSH and their partners to address the leading occupational injury hazards facing healthcare workers. This article also provides an overview of the changes that are occurring in the healthcare industry as a result of the evidence-based research on safe patient handling and STF prevention that has been conducted in recent years.",nocancer"Zinc and iron determination in serum and urine samples of thyroid patients using cloud point extraction. A simple and rapid cloud point extraction method was applied for preconcentration of trace quantities of zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) in biological samples (serum and urine) of thyroid patients prior to determination by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. The metals in serum and urine samples were complexed with 1-(2-thiazolylazo)-2-naphthol and entrapped in the surfactant octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol (Triton X-114). After centrifugation, the surfactant-rich phase was diluted with 0.1 M HNO3 in methanol. For optimum recovery of analytes, the influences of the analytical parameters, including pH and amounts of complexing and surfactant reagents, were investigated. Enrichment factors of 66.4 and 70.2 were obtained for the preconcentration of Zn(II) and Fe(III), respectively. The obtained results showed sufficient recoveries (>98%) for Zn(II) and Fe(III) in certified reference materials (CRMs). The proposed method was applied to the determination of Zn(II) and Fe(III) in biological (serum and urine) samples and CRMs.",nocancer"Determination of vitamin A (retinol) in infant and medical nutritional formulas with AOAC method 992.06 using a modified extraction procedure: single-laboratory validation. The applicability of AOAC Official Method 992.06, vitamin A (retinol) in milk-based infant formula can be extended to specialty infant formulas, and medical and adult nutritional products with a few minor modifications to the sample preparation procedure. Currently, AOAC Official Method 992.06 is only applicable to milk-based infant formulas containing >500 IU vitamin A per reconstituted quart. When this method is used as written to test specialty infant formulas, vitamin A recoveries are low compared to results generated with alternate validated vitamin A methods. AOAC Method 992.06 vitamin A recoveries can be improved significantly in specialty infant formulas if the amount of potassium hydroxide used during the saponification step is doubled. With this one minor modification to the sample preparation procedure, AOAC Method 992.06 demonstrates acceptable precision and accuracy for the quantitation of vitamin A (retinol) in specialty infant formulas, milk- and soy-based infant formulas, and adult and medical nutritionals. Because increasing the amount of potassium hydroxide can cause emulsions to form, 2-4 mL aliquots of reagent alcohol may need to be added to some samples to separate the organic and aqueous layers during the extraction step. A single-laboratory validation of these modifications was completed. During validation, 15 different product matrixes were analyzed. The intermediate precision averaged 2.70% RSD, and spike recovery data averaged 96.3%.",nocancer"Optimization and validation of an LC-fLD method for biotin in infant formula, infant cereals, cocoa-malt beverages, and clinical nutrition products. A fast and simple chromatographic method to determine biotin in foods is presented. Biotin is extracted using papain (60 degrees C, 1 h). After pH adjustment and filtration, biotin is determined by LC with fluorescence detection using postcolumn reagent avidin-FITC (avidin labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate). The method has been validated in a large range of products: milk- and soy-based infant formulas, cereals, cocoa-malt beverages, and clinical nutrition products. The method showed recovery rates of 98.1 +/- 5.7% (average +/- SD) in a large range of concentrations. Biotin concentrations determined in infant formula standard reference materials 1846 and 1849 were in agreement with reference values. RSD of repeatability (RSDr) varied from 2.0 to 4.5%, and intermediate reproducibility (RSD(iR)) from 5.8 to 9.4%. LOD and LOQ were 3.0 and 5.0 microg/100 g, respectively. The proposed method is suitable for routine analysis of biotin in fortified foods (infant formulas, infant cereals, cocoa-malt beverages, and clinical nutrition products). It can be used as a faster, more selective, and precise alternative to the classical microbiological determination, and is easily transferable among laboratories.",nocancer"Simple and rapid RP-HPLC method for simultaneous determination of acyclovir and zidovudine in human plasma. Combination therapy with acyclovir and zidovudine is used for the treatment of herpes-infected immunocompromised patients. In the view of the optimal drug concentrations (minimum effective concentrations) for viral suppression and avoidance of drug toxicity, monitoring of drug levels has been considered essential to determine drug concentrations in plasma after administration of a dose of acyclovir and zidovudine. A simple, precise, and rapid RP-HPLC method has been developed for this purpose. Chromatographic separation was performed using methanol-water (50 + 50, v/v), pH 2.5 adjusted with orthophosphoric acid, as an isocratic mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min with an Inertsil ODS (C18) column (5 microm particle size, 250 x 4.60 mm id). Detection was carried out using a UV photo diode array detector at 258 nm. The plasma samples were prepared by a protein precipitation method. The retention time for acyclovir and zidovudine was 3.5 +/- 0.2 and 6.2 +/- 0.3 min, respectively. The method was linear in the range of 200-1800 and 400-3600 ng/mL with LOQ of 200 ng (SD = +/-1.4) and 400 ng (SD = +/-0.9) for zidovudine and acyclovir, respectively, in plasma. The mean accuracy was 98.0 and 96.4%, with average extraction recovery of 64.8 +/- 2.1 and 77.5 +/- 1.7% for lower nominal concentrations of acyclovir and zidovudine, respectively.",nocancer"Sensitive determination of indomethacin in pharmaceuticals and urine by sequential injection analysis and optosensing. A selective and sensitive method based on coupling of sequential injection analysis (SIA) and optosensing was developed and applied to the determination of indomethacin in pharmaceutical and urinary samples. After alkaline hydrolysis, the fluorescent product generated from indomethacin is inserted in the flow system, transitorily retained on an active solid support (Sephadex QAE A-25) filling the flowcell, and monitored at 283/371 nm (lamda ex / lamda em). The system was calibrated for two sample volumes, 100 and 1000 microL. It showed a linear dynamic range of 0.5-6.5 ng/mL, with an LOD of 0.15 ng/mL and an RSD of 3.9% (n=10) when the highest sample volume was used. The proposed fluorometric SIA optosensor was applied to the determination of indomethacin in both pharmaceuticals and urine samples, and satisfactory results were obtained.",nocancer"Endemicity of human metapneumovirus subgenogroups A2 and B2 in Yamagata, Japan, between 2004 and 2009. To clarify a longitudinal epidemiology,we isolated 280 hMPV strains from patients with acute respiratory infections in Yamagata, Japan, between 2004 and 2009.We observed that the high season for hMPV was from winter to spring (between January and May) and the low season was in the fall (around September and October). A further molecular analysis revealed that subgenogroup A2 (A2) strains were the most commonly isolated (151/280; 53.9%), followed by B2 (108/280; 38.6%) and B1 (19/280; 6.8%). Our results suggested that A2 and B2 have been endemically in circulation as the major types almost every year, whereas other subgenogroups have appeared less frequently.",nocancer"Therapies for refractory hypoxemia in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a common and severe form of acute lung injury, resulting from both direct (eg, pneumonia) and indirect (eg, sepsis) pulmonary insults. It is a common cause of admission to the intensive care unit due to hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In some patients, ARDS leads to the development of life-threatening refractory hypoxemia. In these patients, physicians may consider a number of therapies (eg, recruitment maneuvers, prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, high-frequency oscillatory ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) to alleviate hypoxemia in patients unable to maintain reasonable oxygenation while being supported with conventional mechanical ventilation. Although these strategies have demonstrated improved oxygenation with their use, their impact on patient-important outcomes (eg, mortality) remains unproven. However, in the minority of patients with ARDS and refractory hypoxemia, institution of these therapies may be considered on a case-by-case basis. Future studies are needed to elucidate the efficacy of these therapies on outcomes in patients with severe ARDS and refractory hypoxemia.",nocancer"Association of troponin T detected with a highly sensitive assay and cardiac structure and mortality risk in the general population. CONTEXT: Detectable levels of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) are strongly associated with structural heart disease and increased risk of death and adverse cardiovascular events; however, cTnT is rarely detectable in the general population using standard assays. OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence and determinants of detectable cTnT in the population using a new highly sensitive assay and to assess whether cTnT levels measured with the new assay associate with pathological cardiac phenotypes and subsequent mortality. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cardiac troponin T levels were measured using both the standard and the highly sensitive assays in 3546 individuals aged 30 to 65 years enrolled between 2000 and 2002 in the Dallas Heart Study, a multiethnic, population-based cohort study. Mortality follow-up was complete through 2007. Participants were placed into 5 categories based on cTnT levels. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Magnetic resonance imaging measurements of cardiac structure and function and mortality through a median of 6.4 (interquartile range, 6.0-6.8) years of follow-up. RESULTS: In Dallas County, the prevalence of detectable cTnT (>/=0.003 ng/mL) was 25.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.7%-27.4%) with the highly sensitive assay vs 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.1%) with the standard assay. Prevalence was 37.1% (95% CI, 33.3%-41.0%) in men vs 12.9% (95% CI, 10.6%-15.2%) in women and 14.0% (95% CI, 11.2%-16.9%) in participants younger than 40 years vs 57.6% (95% CI, 47.0%-68.2%) in those 60 years and older. Prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy increased from 7.5% (95% CI, 6.4%-8.8%) in the lowest cTnT category (<0.003 ng/mL) to 48.1% (95% CI, 36.7%-59.6%) in the highest (>/=0.014 ng/mL) (P < .001); prevalence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction and chronic kidney disease also increased across categories (P < .001 for each). During a median follow-up of 6.4 years, there were 151 total deaths, including 62 cardiovascular disease deaths. All-cause mortality increased from 1.9% (95% CI, 1.5%-2.6%) to 28.4% (95% CI, 21.0%-37.8%) across higher cTnT categories (P < .001). After adjustment for traditional risk factors, C-reactive protein level, chronic kidney disease, and N-terminal pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide level, cTnT category remained independently associated with all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.8 [95% CI, 1.4-5.2] in the highest category). Adding cTnT categories to the fully adjusted mortality model modestly improved model fit (P = .02) and the integrated discrimination index (0.010 [95% CI, 0.002-0.018]; P = .01). CONCLUSION: In this population-based cohort, cTnT detected with a highly sensitive assay was associated with structural heart disease and subsequent risk for all-cause mortality.",nocancer"Integrating tobacco cessation into mental health care for posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized controlled trial. CONTEXT: Most smokers with mental illness do not receive tobacco cessation treatment. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether integrating smoking cessation treatment into mental health care for veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) improves long-term smoking abstinence rates. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A randomized controlled trial of 943 smokers with military-related PTSD who were recruited from outpatient PTSD clinics at 10 Veterans Affairs medical centers and followed up for 18 to 48 months between November 2004 and July 2009. INTERVENTION: Smoking cessation treatment integrated within mental health care for PTSD delivered by mental health clinicians (integrated care [IC]) vs referral to Veterans Affairs smoking cessation clinics (SCC). Patients received smoking cessation treatment within 3 months of study enrollment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Smoking outcomes included 12-month bioverified prolonged abstinence (primary outcome) and 7- and 30-day point prevalence abstinence assessed at 3-month intervals. Amount of smoking cessation medications and counseling sessions delivered were tested as mediators of outcome. Posttraumatic stress disorder and depression were repeatedly assessed using the PTSD Checklist and Patient Health Questionnaire 9, respectively, to determine if IC participation or quitting smoking worsened psychiatric status. RESULTS: Integrated care was better than SCC on prolonged abstinence (8.9% vs 4.5%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-3.91; P = .004). Differences between IC vs SCC were largest at 6 months for 7-day point prevalence abstinence (78/472 [16.5%] vs 34/471 [7.2%], P < .001) and remained significant at 18 months (86/472 [18.2%] vs 51/471 [10.8%], P < .001). Number of counseling sessions received and days of cessation medication used explained 39.1% of the treatment effect. Between baseline and 18 months, psychiatric status did not differ between treatment conditions. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms for quitters and nonquitters improved. Nonquitters worsened slightly on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 relative to quitters (differences ranged between 0.4 and 2.1, P = .03), whose scores did not change over time. CONCLUSION: Among smokers with military-related PTSD, integrating smoking cessation treatment into mental health care compared with referral to specialized cessation treatment resulted in greater prolonged abstinence.

Inpatient detoxification is a critical element of the continuum of care for chemically dependent individuals, especially for those unable to establish sobriety on an outpatient basis. This study evaluated the impact of one such detoxification program on client outcomes during the year after detoxification. The program was a public/private partnership between Ventura County, California, and Tarzana Treatment Center in Los Angeles. Before admission, applicants agreed to enroll in treatment after detoxification. Clients were contacted at one month post-admission and quarterly thereafter for one year to collect data, corroborated by county records, on treatment and outcome variables. The sample included 117 consecutive admissions between July 2007 and June 2009. Detoxification completion rates and follow-up treatment enrollment rates were substantial: 85% of the sample completed detoxification; 71% enrolled in treatment afterward. Client outcomes were positive, particularly for those enrolled in followup treatment: compared to clients not completing detoxification, and to client functioning in the year before admission, sobriety and employment rates increased, and rates of homelessness, arrests and days incarcerated decreased. The study concludes that public investment in inpatient detoxification services and aftercare is an effective means to decrease both individual and societal costs of addiction.",nocancer"Chronic care and addictions treatment: a feasibility study on the implementation of posttreatment continuing recovery monitoring. In the treatment of drug addiction, as with other chronic conditions, the effects of treatment are significant but not long lasting after discharge unless continuing monitoring is provided. Efforts to help patients sustain positive treatment outcomes are generally directed to community support. Postdischarge checkups can help patients evaluate their behavior and recovery-related issues--similar to a person with diabetes reporting on blood sugar levels and diet and exercise patterns. The challenge for providers is to raise awareness of the importance of continuing recovery monitoring and the responsibility of the treatment program to build a more seamless continuum of care for patients who have completed a primary treatment episode. This article reviews a pilot project of the Department of Alcohol & Drug Services of Santa Clara County, California that tested the feasibility of implementing a continuing recovery monitoring (CRM) service using post-discharge telephone check-ups for volunteer patients (N=32) who completed treatment. The aims of the study were to (a) develop a model for continuing recovery monitoring, (b) gather data on the model's utility including identifying organizational and logistical challenges and, (c) describe several changes needed in the system of care to add CRM. The study showed that the model of continuing recovery monitoring is a feasible way to extend a system's existing continuum of care.",nocancer"A field experiment in capitated payment systems and recovery management: the women's recovery association pilot study. Against the backdrop of shifting perspectives regarding substance abuse policy, upcoming changes to the health care system, and progress toward parity for mental health and substance abuse treatment, an exploratory pilot study is being conducted in San Mateo County, California, to assess the potential of a capitated case rate combined with a recovery management approach in a community-based substance abuse treatment program for women. The rationale for developing the approach, planning, and implementation of the pilot project, the struggle of the agency to transform from episodic treatment to a chronic care model, and a case study that highlights organizational changes are discussed. Lessons learned and implications for the second year of the pilot project are also discussed.",nocancer"Indicated prevention: bridging the gap, one person at a time. In 2007, Riverside County, California, after identifying a gap between the substance abuse prevention and treatment services it offered to individuals, developed the Individual Prevention Services (IPS) program to fill that gap. Over the past two years, the IPS program has provided individualized prevention services on a one-on-one basis at all seven of the county's substance abuse treatment clinics. The IPS program is provided to those individuals who are at highest risk for developing substance abuse related problems, i.e., those individuals who have some history of substance use/misuse, but have not yet reached a point where treatment is indicated. This unique ""one person at a time"" prevention service is provided at no cost to individuals in all age groups (from age 12 to senior citizens) and is based, in part, on a local student assistance model that offers over 20 years of proven results.",nocancer"Inside the black box: measuring addiction treatment services and their relation to outcomes. The adoption of performance-based management has been under consideration by addiction treatment funding agencies, and, recently, many state and county agencies have developed performance-based measurement/management systems in an attempt to improve their treatment system. This article describes one such effort in Los Angeles County, California. The Performance-Based Pilot Project linked treatment encounters (counseling sessions, drug testing, case management, and methadone dosing) with client outcomes (abstinence or reduced drug use at discharge) and longer lengths of stay in treatment. Eleven outpatient counseling programs and three narcotic treatment programs participated in the nine-month project. Results indicated that for both outpatient counseling and narcotic treatment programs, more sessions attended in the first 30 days was associated with better client outcomes and longer lengths of stay. Furthermore, in outpatient counseling programs, more group sessions during the first 30 days predicted abstinence or greater reductions in primary drug use; in narcotic treatment programs, more doses received during the first 30 days was correlated to longer treatment retention. This research implies that increasing the availability of counseling sessions for a client's first 30 days and engaging clients early is a promising area for program efforts to improve treatment outcomes and program performance.",nocancer"Performance improvement in addiction treatment: efforts in California. This article examines performance data improvement efforts among alcohol and other drug (AOD) county and program stakeholders within California's publicly-funded treatment system. County AOD system administrators from approximately two-thirds of California counties (N=37) and a random sample of treatment program managers (N=63) were surveyed about practices and priorities related to using performance data to improve service delivery. Survey results showed that over half (56.8%) of the county administrators reported using performance and/or outcome measures to guide decision-making about the treatment programs with which they contract. Measures of treatment engagement and retention were most frequently reported as high priorities for performance data collection. Treatment providers reported considerable variation with their use of performance measures to improve practices. Overall, findings from this study suggest that many programs and counties are taking steps toward adopting practices of performance measurement and management for treatment improvement, although they still require assistance and support in establishing, collecting, and using performance data.",nocancer"""I've been NIATxed"": participants' experience with process improvement. Process improvement strategies provide industries with a method for improving outcomes and performance at a low cost and with minimal training. In Los Angeles County, two process improvement projects were implemented as a way to improve access to, and engagement and retention in, alcohol and other drug abuse treatment. A qualitative evaluation was completed after the Phase II pilot project to assess how the providers felt about the project, what worked, what did not work, what was learned, and the degree to which process improvements changed program operations. Semistructured interviews were conducted with 33 individuals, representing every level of staff participation in the project. Overall, comments indicated a positive experience for staff, administrators, and clients. Providers noted the relative ease of implementation and how quickly changes resulted in impressive improvements. Challenging issues included resistant staff or a lack of additional resources to pay for the project; however, most noted that these issues were resolved. Interview participants also requested more training on data collection and a reduction in the frequency of the project conference calls. This study gives support to the idea of process improvement being a tool that dramatically improves services to consumers of addiction treatment services.",nocancer"Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) initiatives in California: notable trends, challenges, and recommendations. It is estimated that most substance users are not substance-dependent, yet they misuse alcohol and/or other drugs on a regular basis and are at risk in terms of health and further dependency. Screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) is an intervention model that identifies at-risk substance users and then provides them a patient-centered intervention. A review of selected SBIRT initiatives in California revealed a number of positive trends: the involvement of healthcare settings in substance use prevention; an increase in the number of providers trained in substance use screening; greater use of standardized screening tools; indications of reduced substance use by individuals receiving SBIRT; and the establishment of statewide policy initiatives. Despite these positive trends, SBIRT projects continue to face challenges related to leadership support, staff resources, integration into ongoing protocols, screening, client retention, client confidentiality, and data collection. To assist projects to overcome these challenges and to ensure future adoption and sustainability of SBIRT, state and local authorities can benefit from (a) promoting SBIRT among healthcare leaders, (b) identifying and sharing successful SBIRT ""models"", (c) providing tailored trainings and ongoing technical assistance, (d) educating providers about patient confidentiality and reimbursement laws and regulations, and (e) creating benchmark measures and data collection protocols.",nocancer"Adoption of medications in substance abuse treatment: priorities and strategies of single state authorities. Research has confirmed the effectiveness of medications, when used in conjunction with ongoing counseling, to treat substance abuse disorders. This article describes a national, mixed-methods research project designed to investigate single state authorities' (SSAs) perceptions of adoption of evidence-based practices in substance abuse treatment. Results are focused specifically on medication-assisted treatment, one of five evidence-based practices defined by the National Quality Forum. Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is an important and effective part of comprehensive care options available to clients who are chronically ill with alcohol and other drug disorders. Despite mounting clinical evidence and increased availability, overall rates of implementation and sustained adoption of medications to treat addiction remain limited. The results illustrate that the SSA representatives who fund public treatment programs believe MAT is a priority and worthy of system-wide implementation. Current strategies utilized by SSAs to support the adoption of MAT are detailed, as are barriers to adoption and implementation.",nocancer"Adoption of motivational interviewing and motivational enhancement therapy following clinical trials. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) Clinical Trials Network (CTN) is designed to test drug abuse treatment interventions in multisite clinical trials and to support the translation of effective interventions into practice. In this study, qualitative methods were applied to examine adoption of motivational interviewing and motivational enhancement therapy (MI/MET) in five clinics where these interventions were tested. Participants were clinic staff (n=17) who were interviewed about the MI/MET study, and about whether MI/MET was adopted after the study ended. Although clinics' participation in a clinical trial includes many elements thought to be necessary for later adoption of the intervention, we found that there was ""adoption"" in one clinic, ""partial adoption"" in one clinic, ""counselor adoption"" in one clinic, and ""no adoption"" in two clinics. These findings highlight a distinction between adoption at the organizational and counselor levels, and suggest that a range of adoption outcomes may be observed in the field. Findings are relevant to clinical staff, program directors, administrators and policy makers concerned with improvement of drug abuse treatment systems through adoption of evidence-based practices.",nocancer"Improving the accountability of California's public substance abuse treatment system through the implementation of performance models.

Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a common and serious complication of solid organ transplantation. It is a heterogeneous collection of diagnoses with varied clinical courses and outcomes. The majority of PTLD is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-driven as a result of loss of immune control of EBV-positive B lymphocytes. Risk factors for the development of PTLD thus reflect loss or absence of EBV immunity; they include younger age and pre-transplant EBV naivety, as well as the degree and type of immune suppression, type of organ transplantation, and time from transplantation. Identifying patients at risk for PTLD and developing strategies to prevent PTLD is the subject of much research, and the use of antiviral medications and EBV vaccines has yielded intriguing, albeit preliminary, results. As we learn more about the prognostic factors affecting outcome and the pathogenesis of individual diseases, we are better able to tailor therapy to the individual. Further clinical investigation, including randomized controlled trials, will be important in reaching this goal.",nocancer"Defining asbestos: differences between the built and natural environments. Asbestos - while most think they know what this material is, few understand the current issues surrounding it. Few would also realize that asbestos is the form of a mineral, and even fewer would know that there are different types of asbestos, that not only had different industrial applications, but pose differing health risks when inhaled. Asbestos was in wide-spread use mid-last century in many consumer products, and no doubt saved thousands of lives, but by the latter part of last century concerns over its health risk caused its use to wane, to the point it was removed from many buildings. So in many ways the asbestos story was coming to an end in the 1990s, but two events in the USA - the vermiculite ore produced from Libby, Montana which contained amphibole asbestos and was used in a million homes in the USA as attic insulation and the concern for exposure to asbestos occurring in its natural setting in El Dorado Hills, California led to an increased concern of the potential for low-level environmental exposure to asbestos to the general public. The current dilemma we find ourselves in, especially in the USA, deals with the relationships between our knowledge of handling asbestos and an understanding of its risk potential in the built environment versus the natural environment. And one perfect metaphor for this is the term used by many non-geologists to differentiate asbestos in the built vs natural environment - 'naturally occurring asbestos'. Clearly a misstatement, but only one of many we must deal with as we struggle to understand the risk to humans of natural occurrences of asbestos. This paper will try and address some of these issues centering around those occurring in the USA.",nocancer"Synthetic calcium phosphate ceramics for treatment of bone fractures. Bone is a complex natural material with outstanding mechanical properties and remarkable self-healing capabilities. The mechanical strength is achieved by a complex structure of a mineral part comprising apatitic calcium phosphate crystals embedded in an organic matrix. Bone also contains several types of cells constantly replacing mature bone with new bone. These cells are able to seal fractures and fill gaps with new bone in case of structural damage. However, if a defect exceeds a critical size, surgery is necessary to fill the void with a spacer in order to prevent soft tissue from growing into the defect and delaying the healing process. The spacers, also known as bone grafts, can either be made of fresh bone from the patient, of processed bone from donor organisms, or of synthetic materials chemically similar to the mineral part of bone. Synthetic bone void fillers are also known as bone graft substitutes. This review aims at explaining the biological and chemical background that lead to the development of synthetic bone graft substitutes and gives an overview of the current state of development. It also highlights the multidisciplinary nature of biomaterials research, which combines cell biology and medicine with chemistry, mineralogy, crystallography, and mechanical engineering.",nocancer"Accountability and legal issues in tissue viability nursing.

Technology in education is moving quickly in terms of the hardware and software applications available, but also due to the expectations of an increasingly digitally competent student population. Academics have to rethink their pedagogy in relation to these changes. Nurse educators, in particular, must face the challenge of effectively integrating technology into what is essentially a hands-on, people-centred profession. To date, the factors most commonly cited as barriers to the adoption of e-learning by academics have focused on explicit and tangible ('hard') issues. Less frequently mentioned are the implicit and tacit ('soft') factors which are harder to identify. This article describes a pilot study using Q-methodology to explore the limitations of commonly used research methods in identifying how these hard and soft issues are prioritised by individuals, through the voices of nurse educators.",nocancer"Deciding on a mixed-methods design in a doctoral study. Research in social science, including nursing, can be broadly split into two main types, qualitative and quantitative. Each has strengths and weaknesses. In some studies both methods are employed.

This article highlights some ethical considerations and practicalities that arose when conducting research with men in relation to decision making and seeking help for a sexually transmitted infection (STI). The aim of the study was to explore, using a grounded theory approach, the processes involved in making the decision to seek help. The main issues that arose were in relation to seeking permission and gaining approval, obtaining informed consent and susceptibility to harm. The interview itself and the concept of the researcher as a tool of data collection also gave rise to ethical issues. These issues have implications for the conduct of sensitive research with men and highlight the need for more overt reporting of the ethical issues and practical considerations that arise when planning and conducting research.",nocancer"Ethical challenges in qualitative research: examples from practice.

Leadership in education, particularly special education, implies both knowledge and application of professional behaviors, decisions, and ethics within the field. University students look for best practices in education to be modeled by faculty; this, in turn, underscores a fundamental belief in inclusionary principles. Such modeling is important on every level in teacher education programs, particularly special education programs. The higher a student's level (i.e., undergraduate vs. doctoral), the more notice that student will take of disparities between rhetoric and actions. While reflective practices are explicitly taught in teacher preparation programs to enable professionals to reflect on their own personal and professional practices, teacher education faculty need to employ the same strategy to ensure that they are indeed modeling the practices they teach. This position paper documents the impressions of a doctoral cohort in special education in terms of inclusionary practices demonstrated in a real-life context.",nocancer"Implementation of the guided reading approach with elementary school deaf students. The researchers investigated the effects of the Guided Reading approach (Fountas & Pinnell, 1996) on the reading development of elementary school deaf students over a period of 2 school years. A single-subject experimental research designed was used. Qualitative analyses of observations of instruction and interviews with the teachers were conducted to determine fidelity to the Guided Reading protocol. Visual display of graphed Running Records scores during the 2-year implementation showed that all students improved during intervention, all participants except the oldest group experienced a drop in scores from the end of one school year to the beginning of the next, and that it took months for most students to regain their previous year's scores; some had not done so even by the end of fall term.",nocancer"The integration experience of hearing impaired elementary school students in separated and integrated school settings. Integration experiences of hearing impaired German elementary school students in separate educational settings (n = 31) were compared with those of counterparts at the same level in integrated settings (n = 26), and evaluated in regard to psychosocial behavior, semantic-lexical abilities, and communicative skills. Analysis of questionnaire responses and intelligence subtests showed that the only difference between the samples concerned perceived well-being in school, and favored the integrated students. Other percentages of variance are explainable by school type (10%), parents' hearing status (12%), and use of bimodal communication (11%). The integrated students demonstrated a higher level of integration experience, associated with fewer psychosocial abnormalities and better communicative skills. The results indicate that educational setting is not the only factor influencing students' perceived well-being. Other contextual factors, e.g., hearing status of parents and communicative skills, have a similar positive impact on integration experiences",nocancer"Deaf children's engagement in an educational video in American Sign Language. Over time, children's educational television has successfully modified programming to incorporate research-based strategies to facilitate learning and engagement during viewing. However, research has been limited on whether these same strategies would work with preschool deaf children viewing videos in American Sign Language. In a descriptive study, engagement behaviors of 25 preschool deaf children during multiple viewings of an educational video in ASL were examined. The video incorporated research-based interactive strategies to facilitate engagement while targeting vocabulary through ASL, fingerspelling, and English print. Each of 3 viewing sessions was recorded; videos were transcribed and coded for frequency of children's movements, pointing, fingerspelling, and signing. Behaviors were analyzed for frequency within and across multiple viewings and by level of signing skills. It was found that each of these engagement behaviors occurred frequently throughout viewings and increased across multiple viewings regardless of a child's age or signing skills.",nocancer"Enrollment trends in deaf education teacher preparation programs, 1973-2009. The number of deaf education teacher preparation programs and the number of program graduates were tabulated from reference issues of the American Annals of the Deaf beginning in 1973 and progressing every third year through 2009. Programs and graduates reached their highest levels from the mid-1970s through mid-1980s. In 2006 and 2009, only about one fourth as many students were majoring in deaf education in relation to the general U.S. college population as in 1973, 1976, and 1979. Yet because the population of children identified as deaf and hard of hearing has also declined, the ratio of program graduates to deaf children has stayed relatively balanced for the past 20 years. Current challenges faced by teacher preparation programs include increases in interpreter preparation programs and programs for teaching American Sign Language, as well as the changing nature of the role of teacher of the deaf.",nocancer"Pediatric cochlear implantation: a qualitative study of parental decision-making processes in Flanders, Belgium. Factors contributing to parents' decision when they choose between cochlear implantation (CI) and traditional hearing aids for their child were examined. The subjects were children with severe/profound hearing loss, born 1999-2001, registered in the universal neonatal hearing screening program in the Flanders region of Belgium. Qualitative data collected retrospectively from parents were subjected to thematic content analysis. In their responses to professional advice, parents were segmented into 3 groups: (a) those whose primary considerations were the importance of oral language development and the relative potential of CI and traditional hearing aids; (b) those for whom alternative factors (e.g., medical risks, ethical issues) were paramount, even in the face of professional advocacy of CI; (c) those who followed professional advice against CI. The researchers conclude that care professionals should be sensitive to the impact of their advice and other factors in parental decision making.",nocancer"A comparison of the anticipated benefits and received outcomes of pediatric cochlear implantation: parental perspectives. Findings of a study that investigated parents' expectations and experiences of their children's outcomes with cochlear implants are presented. A survey completed by 247 parents whose children had received implants in eastern Australia compared parents' reports of their preimplant expectations with their experiences of postimplant outcomes on several items related to communication, academic, and psychosocial domains. Quantitative findings derived from the survey data were extended and elaborated on by qualitative findings from interviews with 27 of the parents. The findings indicated that parents' relatively high expectations of their children's outcomes largely had been met, although a tenth of survey respondents reported that their expectations had not been met. It appeared that professionals generally provided parents with realistic expectations. The qualitative findings revealed a complex interaction among parents' expectations, hopes, and determination that their children would do well with the implant. Implications for professionals are discussed.",nocancer"The horror of being deaf and in prison. Being Deaf and in prison is a horror. The main fear of prison inmates, whether Deaf or hearing, is that they will be raped, killed, or subjected to other forms of violence. Such fears are based in reality. The recent overcrowding of jails and prisons has increased these problems significantly. A major reason for this situation is the blatant violation of the Americans With Disabilities Act by most jails and prisons in the United States. This includes the failure to provide interpreting services for necessary activities and facilities such as religious services, educational programs, vocational training, faith-based prisons, and mental health treatment for addiction. The author discusses other problems faced by inmates who are Deaf and offers suggestions for correcting injustices faced by those who are Deaf in American jails and prisons.",nocancer"High resolution imaging of actin filaments in living cells under physilogically relevant conditions using apertureless near-field microscopy.

Compared with simultaneously obtained AFM topographic image, the apertureless SNOM data provides greater detail on these cellular structures and the spatial resolution of the apertureless SNOM fluorescence image appears to be about 100 nm.",nocancer"Glutaraldehyde mediated conjugation of amino-coated magnetic nanoparticles with albumin protein for nanothermotherapy. A novel bioconjugation of amino saline capped Fe3O4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was developed by applying glutaraldehyde as activator. Briefly, Fe3O4 MNs were synthesized by the chemical co-precipitation method. Surface modification of the prepared MNPs was performed by employing amino saline as the coating agent. Glutaraldehyde was further applied as an activation agent through which BSA was conjugated to the amino-coated MNPs. The structure of the BSA-MNs was confirmed by FTIR analysis. Physico-chemical characterizations of the BSA-MNPs, such as surface morphology, surface charge and magnetic properties were investigated by Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), zeta-Potential and Vibrating Sample Magnetometer (VSM), etc. Magnetic inductive heating characteristics of the BSA-MNPs were analyzed by exposing the MNPs suspension (magnetic fluid) under alternative magnetic field (AMF). The results demonstrate that BSA was successfully conjugated with amino-coated MNs mediated through glutaraldehyde activation. The nanoparticles were spherical shaped with approximately 10 nm diameter. Possessing ideal magnetic inductive heating characteristics, which can generate very rapid and efficient heating while upon AMF exposure, BSA-MNPs can be applied as a novel candidature for magnetic nanothermotherapy for cancer treatment. In vitro cytotoxicity study on the human hepatocellular liver carcinoma cells (HepG-2) indicates that BSA-MNP is an efficient agent for cancer nanothermotherapy with satisfied biocompatibility, as rare cytotoxicity was observed in the absence of AMF. Moreover, our investigation provides a methodology for fabrication protein conjugated MNPs, for instance monoclonal antibody conjugated MNPs for targeting cancer nanothermotherapy.",nocancer"The role of extended duties dental nurses in applying fluoride varnish for the prevention and control of dental caries. The role of extended duties dental nurses (EDDNs) in undertaking preventive dental care has provided an opportunity for their direct involvement in patient care, both at an individual patient level and as part of a population wide health improvement initiative. The article describes the developing role of the dental nurse in the clinical application of fluoride varnish, with associated evidence of effectiveness for the prevention and control of dental caries. The use of fluoride varnish as being central to caries preventive programmes for individual patients judged at risk of future dental caries is considered. A Scottish dental public health initiative which utilizes these extended skills and the benefits of fluoride varnish application is described. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This paper illustrates how EDDNs can help to foster a greater team approach to overall patient care and preventive practice by applying fluoride varnish as part of an effective caries preventive programme.",nocancerRadiation protection: protection of patients undergoing cone beam computed tomography examinations. Cone beam computed tomography is becoming a popular imaging modality in dentistry. The effective dose from these examinations is generally higher than conventional plain film radiography. This article outlines the ways of protecting patients from the harmful effects of radiation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Cone beam computed tomography is an emerging imaging modality. The effective doses are generally higher than conventional radiography and it is therefore important that anyone requesting or performing these investigations understands how to keep the doses to patients as low as reasonably practicable.,nocancer"Medics against violence--the development of a new violence prevention intervention for schools. This article outlines the rationale, evidence base and development of a new anti-violence intervention for schools delivered in the school setting by healthcare professionals. It is an example of multi-professional and mutli-disciplinary working and demonstrates how all healthcare professionals can be involved in wider healthcare issues. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The majority of victims of violence are young men. Most incidents of interpersonal violence involve injury to the head and neck area, including the dentition. The Medics against Violence Schools Project is very relevant to Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, Oral Surgeons and General Dental Practitioners all of whom may have to deal with the sequelae of such injuries.",nocancer"Age-related oral changes. Age-related oral changes are seen in the oral hard and soft tissues as well as in bone, the temporomandibular joints and the oral mucosa.

Clinical Relevance: With an ageing population retaining more of its natural teeth for longer, dental professionals should expect to observe oral age changes more frequently.",nocancer"Peri-implant diseases. Peri-implant diseases are inflammatory conditions that affect the soft and hard supporting tissues around implant fixtures. Peri-implant mucositis usually responds to oral hygiene instructions, scaling and prophylaxis, but peri-implantitis, which involves bone resorption, has less predictable treatment outcomes following non-surgical management. Adjunctive treatment for decontaminating sites may include the use of antimicrobials and resistant cases may sometimes be managed with a surgical approach. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: As dental implant-retained prostheses become more popular the prevalence of peri-implant complications will also increase. Dental practitioners and care professionals should appreciate their potential roles in the management of these conditions.",nocancer"An overview of three-dimensional imaging in dentistry. This paper reviews the role of three-dimensional digital imaging in dentistry and its related specialties. Current methods of image capture of the dentition are described, along with the current status of CAD/CAM-based restorative treatment.

The integration of CBCT with state-of-the-art computer planning systems for implantology is described. The application of multi-modal imaging techniques in the management of orthognathic and cleft lip and palate patients is explained and potential future educational benefits are considered. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: With three-dimensional digital imaging and its related technologies advancing rapidly, it is important for both general and specialist dental practitioners to have an awareness of its current and potential future roles in clinical practice.",nocancer"Nursing recognition and response to signs of clinical deterioration. The suboptimal assessment of patients for signs of clinical deterioration and the subsequent response has led to the development of national guidelines and tools for tracking and responding to these situations. Such tools can provide guidance but ultimately the clinical skill, decision making and collaboration of professional practitioners determine optimal care. The use of track-and-trigger tools is insufficient to provide optimal care due to the many factors that affect patient journeys. The clinical knowledge and skill of nurses are important to this process and in achieving safe patient care. This article focuses on the clinical implications of the knowledge and experience of nurses, as well as their role in team working when recognising and responding to clinical deterioration.",nocancer"Preventing abuse of older people.

The debate on the interaction between disease-specific programmes and health system strengthening in the last few years has intensified as experts seek to tease out common ground and find solutions and synergies to bridge the divide. Unfortunately, the debate continues to be largely academic and devoid of specificity, resulting in the issues being irrelevant to health care workers on the ground. Taking the theme 'What would entice HIV- and tuberculosis (TB)-programme managers to sit around the table on a Monday morning with health system experts', this viewpoint focuses on infection control and health facility safety as an important and highly relevant practical topic for both disease-specific programmes and health system strengthening. Our attentions, and the examples and lessons we draw on, are largely aimed at sub-Saharan Africa where the great burden of TB and HIV AIDS resides, although the principles we outline would apply to other parts of the world as well. Health care infections, caused for example by poor hand hygiene, inadequate testing of donated blood, unsafe disposal of needles and syringes, poorly sterilized medical and surgical equipment and lack of adequate airborne infection control procedures, are responsible for a considerable burden of illness amongst patients and health care personnel, especially in resource-poor countries. Effective infection control in a district hospital requires that all the components of a health system function well: governance and stewardship, financing,infrastructure, procurement and supply chain management, human resources, health information systems, service delivery and finally supervision. We argue in this article that proper attention to infection control and an emphasis on safe health facilities is a concrete first step towards strengthening the interaction between disease-specific programmes and health systems where it really matters - for patients who are sick and for the health care workforce who provide the care and treatment.",nocancer"Rational noncompliance with prescribed medical treatment. Despite the attention that patient noncompliance has received from medical researchers, patient noncompliance remains poorly understood and difficult to alter. With a better theory of patient noncompliance, both greater success in achieving compliance and greater respect for patient decision making are likely. The theory presented, which uses a microeconomic approach, bridges a gap in the extant literature that has so far ignored the contributions of this classic perspective on decision making involving the tradeoff of costs and benefits. The model also generates a surprising conclusion: that patients are typically acting rationally when they refuse to comply with certain treatments. However, compliance is predicted to rise with increased benefits and reduced costs. The prediction that noncompliance is rational is especially true in chronic conditions at the point that treatment begins to move closer to the medically ideal treatment level. Although the details of this theory have not been tested empirically, it is well supported by existing prospective and retrospective studies.",nocancer"Is equal moral consideration really compatible with unequal moral status? The issue of moral considerability, or how much moral importance a being's interests deserve, is one of the most important in animal ethics. Some leading theorists--most notably David DeGrazia--have argued that a principle of ""equal moral consideration"" is compatible with ""unequal moral status."" Such a position would reconcile the egalitarian force of equal consideration with more stringent obligations to humans than animals. The article presents arguments that equal consideration is not compatible with unequal moral status, thereby forcing those who would justify significantly different moral protections for humans and animals to argue for unequal consideration.",nocancer"Traditional knowledge and intellectual property. Biotechnological inventions are sometimes based upon the traditional knowledge of indigenous communities about the beneficial properties of plants and animals. Some institutions have adopted the uniqueness of traditional knowledge approach, which maintains that the indigenous communities have sui generis rights to a share of the profits from these inventions. Others have adopted the protection of inventive steps approach, which maintains that the inventors are entitled to the full profits from the invention if it involves a non-obvious and novel inventive step. The article analyzes this debate at the Convention on Biological Diversity, at the World Intellectual Property Organization, and at the World Trade Organization. It concludes that the adherents of the uniqueness of traditional knowledge approach have not justified their claims.",nocancer"International stem cell tourism and the need for effective regulation. Part II: Developing sound oversight measures and effective patient support. Part I of this article, published in the March 2010 issue of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics Journal, traces and addresses the provision of unproven stem cell treatments in Russia and India, examines the concept of innovative treatment, and concludes that stronger regulations are needed to protect the health and informed choices of patients. The current paper, Part II, proposes that the regulatory frameworks for the development of safe and efficacious treatments in effect in the United States and the United Kingdom provide examples of strong oversight measures from which countries seeking to obtain international credibility for their biotechnological competence could draw when developing regulations for stem cell treatments. Major sources of information available to persons who consider receiving such unproven treatments are explored in order to understand and address their concerns. The paper concludes with proposed measures to inform those considering the pursuit of unproven stem cell treatments abroad more accurately about their efficacy and safety and provide them with improved medical and social support in their home countries.",nocancer"Trends in dental caries prevalence, severity and unmet treatment need levels in South Africa between 1983 and 2002. OBJECTIVES: To determine trends in dental caries prevalence, severity and unmet treatment need levels amongst South African children. METHODOLOGY: Data obtained from three National Oral Health surveys (1982, 1988/89, 1999/2002) was used. RESULTS: Prevalence of caries amongst 12-year-old children decreased from 64.4% (1982) through 54.9% (1988/89) to 41.7% (1999/2002) and the DMFT decreased significantly (p < 0.05) from 2.54 (1982) through 1.73 (1988/89) to 1.17 (1999/2002). Unmet treatment need increased from 70.5% (1982), 72.3% (1988/89) to 75.2% (1999/2002). Significant decreases (p < 0.05) were recorded in the DMFT (1982-2002) in White, 75.3%; Asian, 64.1%; Black, 49.8%; and Coloured groups, 44.8%. High levels of untreated caries (D) and very low levels of treatment (M and F) were also observed. The highest mean dmft/DMFT for 6- and 12-year-olds respectively were recorded in the coastal areas of Metro Cape (5.1/1.86); followed by Port Elizabeth (3.86/1.37) and Durban (3.42/1.33); and the lowest in the interior--Bloemfontein (2.47/0.73). CONCLUSIONS: Caries reduced significantly during the past 20 years; is more prevalent and severe amongst Coloured and Black population groups and in coastal regions compared to the interior region. Unmet treatment need in 12- and 15-year-old children increased and more than 70% of caries in 6-, 12- and 15-year-old children go untreated.",nocancer"Smoking practices of dental and oral health students at the University of the Western Cape. INTRODUCTION: The World Health Organisation code of practice on tobacco control urges health care professionals to lead by example by reducing smoking among them, act as role models for their patients and introduce tobacco control in the public health agenda of their country. AIMS: Describe dental and oral health student smoking practices, risk perception and the association between smoking status and providing smoking related advice to patients. METHOD: A descriptive, cross sectional study of dental and oral health students using a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: The response rate was 62% (N = 375). Smoking status indicated that 15% were past smokers and 23% were current smokers (33.8% Male vs 17.6% Female: p < 0.001). The mean age of smoking initiation was 16 years (SD = 2.932). Students smoked because of ""addiction"", ""stress"", ""habit'; ""enjoyment"", and ""to socialise"". Only 22% of current smokers felt able to stop smoking. There were no significant differences between smokers and non-smokers in their perceived knowledge, confidence and skill to provide smoking related advice to patients. CONCLUSION: The increasing prevalence of smoking among females observed globally is also evident in this population. Student smoking status does not influence practices in providing smoking related advice to their patients.",nocancer"Self-management skills for people with type 2 diabetes. This article discusses type 2 diabetes, including the underlying causes and the treatment algorithm needed to manage this condition. The article also explores the educational opportunities available to encourage self-management of this chronic life long condition.",nocancer"Management of diabetes in patients at the end of life. Diabetes is a complex metabolic disorder that is more common in patients with cancer than in the general population. The ethical dilemmas facing many healthcare professionals in the management of diabetes during the terminal phase of life include the timing of withholding or withdrawing treatment. Communication can also be difficult between healthcare professionals, patients and their families at this time. If the patient's preferences have not been discussed at an earlier stage in the illness trajectory, mismanagement of diabetes may occur. Local protocols on diabetes management at the end of life have been developed in some areas, but there are no national or standardised guidelines. This can result in fragmented care. This article explores the need for better communication and the development of national guidelines so that the quality of end of life care for patients with diabetes can be improved.",nocancer"Neuropathic pain: clinical features, assessment and treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Many mandible fractures can be treated effectively with closed methods. The authors describe a simple method, with the use of commercial cable ties, to obtain maxillary-mandibular fixation (MMF). This technique can be effectively employed to treat certain mandible fractures. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: A simple, safe and cost-effective method for treating mandible fractures by employing commercial cable ties to obtain MMF was developed. A clinical prospective study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of this technique. METHODS: Twenty consecutive patients were enrolled into this study. MMF was obtained with cable ties. The study group was evaluated according to occlusion, clinical outcome, discomfort level and complications. RESULTS: Ninety percent of patients had normal occlusion after treatment. All fractures were clinically united. Seventy percent described their discomfort level as moderate during placement of the cable ties. The majority of patients experienced minimal discomfort both during MMF (95%), and with the removal of the cable ties (90%). No major complications occurred. Early loosening of MMF occurred in three patients with resultant subjective malocclusion in two of these. CONCLUSIONS: Employing commercial cable ties to obtain MMF for the treatment of certain mandible fractures is safe, simple, effective and cost-effective.",nocancerInhaled bronchodilators for chronic bronchitis and emphysema.

The Health Systems in Transition (HiT) profiles are country-based reports that provide a detailed description of health systems and of policy initiatives in progress or under development. HiTs examine different approaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services and the role of the main actors in health systems. They also describe the institutional framework, process, content, and implementation of health and health care policies, highlighting challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis. Undoubtedly the dominant issue in the Dutch health care system at present is the fundamental reform that came into effect in 2006. With the introduction of a single compulsory health insurance scheme, the dual system of public and private insurance for curative care became history. Managed competition for providers and insurers became a major driver in the health care system. This has meant fundamental changes in the roles of patients, insurers, providers and the government. Insurers now negotiate with providers on price and quality and patients choose the provider they prefer and join a health insurance policy which best fits their situation. To allow patients to make these choices, much effort has been made to make information on price and quality available to the public. The role of the national government has changed from directly steering the system to safeguarding the proper functioning of the health markets. With the introduction of market mechanisms in the health care sector and the privatization of former sickness funds, the Dutch system presents an innovative and unique variant of a social health insurance system. Since the stepwise realization of the blueprint of the system has not yet been completed, the health care system in The Netherlands should be characterized as being in transition. Many measures have been taken to move from the old to the new system as smoothly as possible. Financial measures intended to prevent sudden budgetary shocks and payment mechanisms have been (and are) continuously adjusted and optimized. Organizational measures aimed at creating room for all players to become accustomed to their new role in the regulated market. As the system is still a ""work in progress"", it is too early to evaluate the effects and the consequences of the new system in terms of accessibility, affordability, efficiency and quality. Dutch primary care, with gatekeeping GPs at its core, is a strong foundation of the health care system. Gatekeeping GPs are a relatively unusual element in social health insurance systems. The strong position of primary care is considered to prevent unnecessary use of more expensive secondary care, and promote consistency and coordination of individual care. It continues to be a policy priority in The Netherlands. The position of the patient in The Netherlands is strongly anchored in several laws concerning their rights, their relation to providers and insurers, access to information, and possibilities to complain in case of maltreatment. In terms of quality and efficiency of the health care system, The Netherlands is, with some notable exceptions (e.g. implementation of innovations such as day surgery and electronic patient records), an average performer when compared to other wealthy countries. It is too early to tell whether efficiency and quality gains will occur as a result of the 2006 reform.",nocancer"Azerbaijan: health system review. The Health Systems in Transition (HiT) profiles are country-based reports that provide a detailed description of a health system and of policy initiatives in progress or under development. HiTs examine different approaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services and the role of the main actors in health systems; describe the institutional framework, process, content and implementation of health and health care policies; and highlight challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis. Azerbaijan gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Reform of the health care system in Azerbaijan has been incremental so that organizationally it still has many of the key hallmarks of the Soviet model of health care, the Semashko system. However, relatively low levels of government expenditure on health as a proportion of gross domestic product since independence has meant that out of pocket (OOP) payments accounted for almost 62% of total health expenditure in 2007. This has serious implications for access to care and financial risk protection for vulnerable households. The private provision of services is an increasingly important part of the health system, and services provided in parallel by other ministries and state enterprises continue to account for a certain amount of health expenditure. Revenues from the recent oil boom have been used to fund large capital investment projects such as the building of new hospitals with the latest technology and the import of modern equipment. However, future plans include the strengthening of primary care and the introduction of mandatory health insurance as part of major reforms to the health financing system.",nocancer"Tajikistan: health system review. The Health Systems in Transition (HiT) profiles are country-based reports that provide a detailed description of a health system and of policy initiatives in progress or under development. HiTs examine different approaches to the organization, financing and delivery of health services and the role of the main actors in health systems; describe the institutional framework, process, content and implementation of health and health care policies; and highlight challenges and areas that require more in-depth analysis. Tajikistan is undergoing a complex transition from a health system inherited from the Soviet period to new forms of management, financing and health care provision. Following independence and the consequences of the civil war, health funding collapsed and informal out-of-pocket payments became the main source of revenue, with particularly severe consequences for the poor. With the aim of ensuring equitable access to health care and formalizing out-of-pocket payments, the Ministry of Health developed a programme that encompassed a basic benefit package (also known as the guaranteed benefit package) for people in need and formal co-payments for other groups of the population. One of the main challenges for the future will be to reorient the health system towards primary care and public health rather than hospital-based secondary and tertiary care. Pilots of primary care reform, introducing per capita financing, are under way in three of the country's oblasts. There are marked geographical imbalances in health care resources and financing, favouring the capital and regional centres over rural areas. There are also significant inequities in health care expenditures across regions. The quality of care is another major concern, owing to the lack of investment in health facilities and technologies, an insufficient supply of pharmaceuticals, poorly trained health care workers, and a lack of medical protocols and systems for quality improvement.",nocancer"Risk assessment for recurrent venous thrombosis. Venous thrombosis is a common disease that frequently recurs. Recurrence can be prevented by anticoagulants, albeit at the cost of bleeding. Thus, assessment of the risk of recurrence is important to balance the risks and benefits of anticoagulation treatment. Many clinical and laboratory risk factors for recurrent venous thrombosis have been established. Nevertheless, prediction of recurrence in an individual patient remains a challenge. Detection of some laboratory markers is associated with only a moderate risk of recurrence, and the relevance of others is not known. Many patients have several risk factors and the effect of combined defects is obscure. Routine screening for these laboratory markers should therefore be abandoned. Risk assessment can be improved by measurement of global markers that encompass the effects of clotting and fibrinolytic disorders. Analysis of preliminary data suggests that risk assessment can also be refined through integration of prothrombotic coagulation changes and clinical risk factors.",nocancer"Sickle-cell disease. Sickle-cell disease is one of the most common severe monogenic disorders in the world. Haemoglobin polymerisation, leading to erythrocyte rigidity and vaso-occlusion, is central to the pathophysiology of this disease, although the importance of chronic anaemia, haemolysis, and vasculopathy has been established. Clinical management is basic and few treatments have a robust evidence base. One of the main problems of sickle-cell disease in children is the development of cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairment, and the role of blood transfusion and hydroxycarbamide for prevention of these complications is starting to be understood. Recurrent episodes of vaso-occlusion and inflammation result in progressive damage to most organs, including the brain, kidneys, lungs, bones, and cardiovascular system, which becomes apparent with increasing age. Most people with sickle-cell disease live in Africa, where little is known about this disease; however, we do know that the disorder follows a more severe clinical course in Africa than for the rest of the world and that infectious diseases have a role in causing this increased severity of sickle-cell disease. More work is needed to develop effective treatments that specifically target pathophysiological changes and clinical complications of sickle-cell disease.",nocancer"Oral rivaroxaban for symptomatic venous thromboembolism. BACKGROUND: Rivaroxaban, an oral factor Xa inhibitor, may provide a simple, fixed-dose regimen for treating acute deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and for continued treatment, without the need for laboratory monitoring. METHODS: We conducted an open-label, randomized, event-driven, noninferiority study that compared oral rivaroxaban alone (15 mg twice daily for 3 weeks, followed by 20 mg once daily) with subcutaneous enoxaparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (either warfarin or acenocoumarol) for 3, 6, or 12 months in patients with acute, symptomatic DVT. In parallel, we carried out a double-blind, randomized, event-driven superiority study that compared rivaroxaban alone (20 mg once daily) with placebo for an additional 6 or 12 months in patients who had completed 6 to 12 months of treatment for venous thromboembolism. The primary efficacy outcome for both studies was recurrent venous thromboembolism. The principal safety outcome was major bleeding or clinically relevant nonmajor bleeding in the initial-treatment study and major bleeding in the continued-treatment study. RESULTS: The study of rivaroxaban for acute DVT included 3449 patients: 1731 given rivaroxaban and 1718 given enoxaparin plus a vitamin K antagonist. Rivaroxaban had noninferior efficacy with respect to the primary outcome (36 events [2.1%], vs. 51 events with enoxaparin-vitamin K antagonist [3.0%]; hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44 to 1.04; P<0.001). The principal safety outcome occurred in 8.1% of the patients in each group. In the continued-treatment study, which included 602 patients in the rivaroxaban group and 594 in the placebo group, rivaroxaban had superior efficacy (8 events [1.3%], vs. 42 with placebo [7.1%]; hazard ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.39; P<0.001). Four patients in the rivaroxaban group had nonfatal major bleeding (0.7%), versus none in the placebo group (P=0.11). CONCLUSIONS: Rivaroxaban offers a simple, single-drug approach to the short-term and continued treatment of venous thrombosis that may improve the benefit-to-risk profile of anticoagulation.

BACKGROUND: Generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAgP) encompasses a distinct type of periodontal disease exhibiting much more rapid periodontal tissue destruction than chronic periodontitis. The best method for management of GAgP may include the use of both regenerative periodontal techniques and the administration of systemic antibiotics. METHODS: The treatment of a case of GAgP over a period of 6.7 years is presented in this case report. Initial periodontal therapy (week 1- 32) consisted of supragingival plaque control and three appointments of scaling and root planing. Based on the periodontal pathogens isolated (5 species), the patient also received metronidazole plus amoxicillin for one week, followed 10 weeks later by metronidazole plus amoxicillin/clavulanate for one week. The patient was put on regular supportive periodontal therapy (SPT) thereafter. Orthodontic treatment was performed after completion of the initial therapy for 96 weeks. Measurements of clinical attachment level, bleeding on probing and plaque index were obtained at every examination. RESULTS: Antimicrobial and mechanical treatment resulted in eradication of all periopathogens and significantly improved all clinical parameters. During orthodontic treatment and active maintenance, there was no relapse of GAgP. The patient participated in SPT for 194 weeks and thereafter decided to discontinue SPT. Twenty-four months later a relapse of GAgP was diagnosed and all teeth had to be extracted. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that a combined mechanical and antimicrobial treatment approach can lead to consistent resolution of GAgP. Further studies including a larger number of cases are warranted to validate these findings.",nocancer"Periodontal bone loss and self-reported medical conditions in a dental school patient population. PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of periodontal bone loss and to assess the prevalence of self-reported medical conditions in patients with and without periodontal bone loss in Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2103 dental records with complete data from patients > or = 18 years of age admitted to the King Abdulaziz University Faculty of Dentistry during the year 2005 were included. Age, gender, nationality and self reported medical history were abstracted from the dental records. Periodontal bone loss was determined by a single examiner using panoramic radiographs that were taken prior to any dental treatment. Descriptive statistics, t-test, chi-square and logistic regression models were used for data analyses. RESULTS: About 20% of the study sample reported a positive history for one or more medical conditions. Diabetes was the most frequently reported condition (7.4%), followed by hypertension (5.4%) and anemia (3%). Radiographic alveolar bone loss at one or more sites was found in 71.6% of the sample. The mean number of sites with alveolar bone loss was significantly higher among individuals with diabetes and hypertension than those without these conditions (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Prevalence of periodontal bone loss is high in the present sample, especially among those with chronic medical conditions. Collaboration between dental and medical professionals is needed for better oral and general health.",nocancer"The severity, extent and recurrence of necrotizing periodontal disease in relation to HIV status and CD4+ T cell count. South Africa ranks among the three countries with the highest prevalence of HIV infection in sub-Saharan Africa, with an estimated 29.5% of women attending antenatal clinics being infected. Necrotizing periodontal disease is a well recognized HIV-associated oral condition. The objective of this investigation was to determine a possible correlation between the extent, severity and treatment outcome of necrotizing periodontal disease in relation to a person's HIV status and CD4+ T cell count. Data from 105 consecutive patients presenting with necrotizing periodontal disease at an academic oral health centre in South Africa were analysed. All patients were provided with an opportunity to undergo voluntary counseling and testing for HIV infection, were treated for necrotizing periodontal disease and followed over a period of nine months. The mean age of the cohort was 28 years old (range 12 - 52). Of 98 (93.3%) patients unaware of their HIV serostatus at the initial visit, 59 (56.2%) consented to testing. In total 45 (42.9%) were HIV-seropositive with a mean CD4+ T cell count of 222.7 cells/microl and 14 (13.3%) were HIV-seronegative, with a significantly higher mean CD4+ T cell count of 830 cells/microl (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.001), while the status of 46 (43.8%) remained unknown. In 101 (96.2%) patients, > or = 5 tooth sites were affected, and in 27 (26%) > or = 4 mm of gingival tissue were affected. This study, which included HIV-seropositive, HIV-seronegative and persons of unknown HIV status, revealed no statistical evidence that HIV infection was associated with the extent, severity or relapse of necrotizing periodontal disease. No statistically significant association could be demonstrated between the extent, severity and recurrence of necrotizing periodontal disease and a CD4+ T cell count < or = 200 cells/microl among HIV-seropositive patients.",nocancer"Preparation and characterization of different sizes of ethosomes encapsulated with 5-fluorouracil and its experimental study of permeability in hypertrophic scar. With the aim of investigating scar penetration efficiency of different sizes of ethosomes encapsulated with Fluorouracil, three kinds of ethosomes with different sizes were prepared by extruding the vesicles through polycarbonate membrane filters, their encapsulation efficiency of Fluorouracil (5-FU) were investigated by dialysis method, their scar-penetration efficiencies were analyzed by filling Rodanmin 6GO into ethosomes and using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The prepared ethosomes were 216 +/- 19 nm, 107 +/- 13 nm, and 65 +/- 10 nm in diameter respectively, and exhibited good dispersibility. Their encapsulation efficiency of 5-FU were 12%, 34%, and 41%, respectively. The results indicated that the 5-FU penetration was reversely related to the size of the size of the ethosomes. The ethosomes of 65 nm in diameter exhibited maximal fluorescence penetration efficiency which could reach the deep layer of dermis of hypertrophic scar. In conclusion, three different sizes of 5-FU ethosomes were prepared successfully, the ethosomes of 65 nm in diameter with 5-FU can penetrate scar high efficiently, which has potential in application such as anti-scar drug carriers in scar therapy in near future.",nocancer"Co-delivery honokiol and doxorubicin in MPEG-PLA nanoparticles. The combination chemotherapy is an important protocol in cancer therapy. Honokiol shows synergistic anticancer effect with doxorubicin. In this paper, honokiol and doxorubicin co-loaded MPEG-PLA nanoparticles were prepared. The particle size, morphology, in vitro release profile, cytotoxicity and cell proliferation study were studied in detail. The results indicated that honokiol and doxorubicin could be efficiently loaded into MPEG-PLA nanoparticles simultaneously, and could be released out in an extended period in vitro. Meanwhile, honokiol and doxorubicin in MPEG-PLA nanoparticle could efficiently suppress cancer cell proliferation in vitro. The described honokiol and doxorubicin co-loaded MPEG-PLA nanoparticle might be a novel anticancer agent.",nocancer"Gender differences in the vocational satisfaction of physician assistants. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to analyze vocational satisfaction differences by gender as a follow-up of data gathered from a mailed survey study on American physician assistant vocational satisfaction. METHODS: This is an analysis of a database from an original piloted, validated survey with a response rate of 50% from 2,323 labels from the 2003 AAPA's mailing list (n = 1,137). The survey measured vocational satisfaction in terms of career, job, and specialty choice on a forced-choice 6-point Likert-type scale. A qualitative analysis of answers to open-ended questions addressing career satisfiers and dissatisfiers was also conducted. RESULTS: PAs were shown to be highly satisfied with their careers, specialty choices, and jobs. Trends for male PAs showed that they were more satisfied with their careers, specialty choices, and jobs (6-point Likert scale) but female PAs were more likely to refer others into the PA profession than their male counterparts (4-point Likert scale). Statistically significant differences via 2-tailed Mann-Whitney U tests were shown for job satisfaction (P = .02, male Likert mean 3.92 vs. female 3.78) and the likelihood to refer others into the profession (P = .04, female Likert mean 3.43 vs. male 3.33). Twenty-one factors for vocational satisfaction and 29 for dissatisfaction were qualitatively analyzed by gender. The top three satisfiers of helping others, patient interaction, and intellectual challenge were the same by rank regardless of gender. Similarly, the top three dissatisfiers were the same but in reverse order for female and male PAs: (lack of) respect, compensation, and other, for females; and other, compensation, and respect, for males. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated very similar vocational satisfaction measures for female PAs and male PAs via quantitative and qualitative methods with the noteworthy exception that male PAs were statistically more satisfied with their jobs while female PAs were statistically more likely to refer others into the career. These differences, while statistically significant, may be of no practical significance and need to be further studied.",nocancer"Video-rate molecular imaging in vivo with stimulated Raman scattering. Optical imaging in vivo with molecular specificity is important in biomedicine because of its high spatial resolution and sensitivity compared with magnetic resonance imaging. Stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy allows highly sensitive optical imaging based on vibrational spectroscopy without adding toxic or perturbative labels. However, SRS imaging in living animals and humans has not been feasible because light cannot be collected through thick tissues, and motion-blur arises from slow imaging based on backscattered light. In this work, we enable in vivo SRS imaging by substantially enhancing the collection of the backscattered signal and increasing the imaging speed by three orders of magnitude to video rate. This approach allows label-free in vivo imaging of water, lipid, and protein in skin and mapping of penetration pathways of topically applied drugs in mice and humans.",nocancer"Circadian integration of metabolism and energetics. Circadian clocks align behavioral and biochemical processes with the day/night cycle. Nearly all vertebrate cells possess self-sustained clocks that couple endogenous rhythms with changes in cellular environment. Genetic disruption of clock genes in mice perturbs metabolic functions of specific tissues at distinct phases of the sleep/wake cycle. Circadian desynchrony, a characteristic of shift work and sleep disruption in humans, also leads to metabolic pathologies. Here, we review advances in understanding the interrelationship among circadian disruption, sleep deprivation, obesity, and diabetes and implications for rational therapeutics for these conditions.",nocancer"Cooperation and competition: balanced scorecard and hospital privatization. PURPOSE: In 2000 the Skane Region (a public authority) and a private contractor made a five-year agreement for the provision of both in-patient care and out-patient medical services to about 30,000 inhabitants in the south-east part of the region. The Skane Region is the main provider of health care to about one million inhabitants in the south of Sweden and is responsible for all health care (private and public), including ten hospitals. This paper seeks to answer the question of how the Skane Region can control and cooperate with a private contractor, entering into competition with the public health care providers in the region. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This is a longitudinal study conducted between 2001-2006. It is based on 28 taped interviews with employees responsible for the contracting process, participating observations and comprehensive secondary material. The study presents experiences made by the contractor and the public authority on how to work out and follow-up assignments within the health care sector regarding patient interest, public interest and professional medical interest. FINDINGS: Measurement within the frames of the balanced scorecard (BSC) made it possible to control both volumes and health care quality delivered by the private competing contractor. The political purchaser claims that the Skane Region has established a cost-effective and successful control system based on trust and measurement. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: This paper reports on a control system, between public purchaser and a private provider within health care, that focuses on and follow-up not only health care production but also health care quality.",nocancer"Quality differentials and reproductive health service utilisation determinants in India. PURPOSE: This paper seeks to establish relationships between women's reproductive health service use, assessed longitudinally and by facility type, with service quality perceptions related to public or private health facilities. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The study was mainly secondary and quantitative in nature. It included analysing data collected by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) and The Johns Hopkins University (JHU) as a follow-up study to the 1998-1999 National Family Health Survey (NFHS-2). The follow-up survey was carried out in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Bihar and Jharkhand. In 2002-2003, these four states were selected to capture socio-economic and demographic variations. Analysis includes composite indices and logistic regression analysis. A scale was constructed to measure utilisation levels. Dimensions include: service proximity, doctor availability, waiting time, medicines, facility cleanliness, dignified treatment, privacy, service affordability and treatment effectiveness. FINDINGS: Findings indicate that doctor availability, waiting time, cleanliness, privacy and affordability at private health facilities enhance the probability that a health facility will be used for any reproductive health purpose. At the combined states level, medicine availability and treatment effectiveness at public health facilities enhances service use. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The major limitation is that the study includes only selected Indian states. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The findings may enhance Indian service-quality policy. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The paper's main contribution is that seemingly for the first time in India, healthcare service use has been measured longitudinally and then explained through service quality variables by comparing public and private health facilities.",nocancer"Educational governance in the NHS: a literature review. PURPOSE: This paper aims to survey the literature relating to educational governance's application to healthcare. Its purpose is to establish the extent to which this type of governance is recognised by healthcare staff, and to develop an understanding of how it is defined and used. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The starting point for the literature review was an academic database search supplemented by a Google Scholar search. The results were sifted using evidence strength criteria and filtered for relevance using secondary keywords. FINDINGS: The educational governance in healthcare literature search indicates that this is a relatively under-researched area. There are few attempts to define educational governance, although several authors note similarities with clinical governance. Authors cite educational governance as an important component of integrated approaches to healthcare governance, noting inter-dependent relationships between areas such as clinical governance, organisational development and risk management. RESEARCH LIMITATION/IMPLICATIONS: Given the diverse academic and grey literature used for the review, it was difficult to apply conventional evidence-strength scales, especially because most articles cited in the text are based on expert opinion rather than systematic review. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The review highlights educational governance's value to healthcare organisations and provides references for organisational staff contemplating developing this area. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The paper is the first known attempt to survey the literature relating to National Health Service educational governance.",nocancer"Checking in healthcare safety: theoretical basis and practical application. PURPOSE: Healthcare includes important processes such as checking to reduce errors. Checking is a prescribed part of many patient care activities with many checks being performed during one hospital admission. Some may be standard but unwritten practices, whereas others are laid down in official guidance. Errors in the bedside checking procedure are the commonest cause of mis-transfusion, so more thorough checking could prevent adverse events. This paper aims to explore and enhance understanding regarding healthcare checking procedures. In doing so it seeks to identify a further research agenda. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The computerised databases CINAHL, PsycLIT, EMBASE, PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE were searched using specific indexing terms and free text including ""bedside, peri-operative safety, theatre checking and checklists"". Only English publications were included. FINDINGS: Like any human activity, checking is part of personality and behaviour. There are several psychological factors relevant to patient safety, including: memory, prospective memory, automaticity and responsibility. All are relevant to healthcare. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Bandolier criteria have not explicitly been used within this review but have been met. It would be beneficial for future reviews to explicitly state how Bandolier criteria are met. This would possibly enhance the publications' scientific quality. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: There is much to learn regarding interacting factors that influence healthcare checking procedures and ultimately checking performance. The authors recommend that relationships between checking and personality should be explored. Furthermore, exploring how healthcare ""mindfulness"" might be promoted and what reminder/checking strategies healthcare staff already use in their day-to-day work routines should be examined. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: Several psychological factors involved in checking and its relevance to healthcare and patient safety are identified. Additionally, recommendations for further research are indicated.",nocancer"Quality management benchmarking: FDA compliance in pharmaceutical industry. PURPOSE: By analyzing and comparing industry and business best practice, processes can be optimized and become more successful mainly because efficiency and competitiveness increase. This paper aims to focus on some examples. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: Case studies are used to show knowledge exchange in the pharmaceutical industry. Best practice solutions were identified in two companies using a benchmarking method and five-stage model. FINDINGS: Despite large administrations, there is much potential regarding business process organization. This project makes it possible for participants to fully understand their business processes. The benchmarking method gives an opportunity to critically analyze value chains (a string of companies or players working together to satisfy market demands for a special product). PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Knowledge exchange is interesting for companies that like to be global players. Benchmarking supports information exchange and improves competitive ability between different enterprises. Findings suggest that the five-stage model improves efficiency and effectiveness. Furthermore, the model increases the chances for reaching targets. The method gives security to partners that did not have benchmarking experience. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The study identifies new quality management procedures. Process management and especially benchmarking is shown to support pharmaceutical industry improvements.",nocancer"Reporting adverse events: Greek doctor and nurse attitudes. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to elicit Greek doctors' and nurses' views about adverse event reporting. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: This is an exploratory study using an adverse events questionnaire administered to 209 doctors and 214 nurses in 14 major Athens universities and tertiary hospitals. FINDINGS: The paper finds that Greek doctors and nurses prefer a strictly confidential or conditionally confidential reporting scheme. Most doctors favoured disclosing department identity, while a nursing majority argued that it should remain unknown. When asked about the person's professional affiliation that, under a confidential scheme, receives reports and gives feedback, most doctors and nurses preferred the receiver to belong to their profession. Most medical personnel preferred the mandatory model or the discretionary model with a set of guidelines exemplifying adverse event types, while a nurse majority preferred the discretionary with a set of guidelines exemplifying adverse events. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: It is necessary to establish a strictly confidential, non-punitive reporting scheme that supports learning and knowledge and one that is separate from any disciplinary scheme. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The study indicates that culture, legal and patient complaint systems do not affect healthcare professional notions with respect to reporting adverse events.",nocancer"Auditing psychiatric out-patient records. PURPOSE: Up-to-date patient records are essential for safe and professional practice. They are an intrinsic component for providing adequate care and ensuring appropriate and systematic treatment 2009 plans. Furthermore, accurate and contemporaneous notes are essential for achieving professional standards from a medico-legal perspective. The study's main aim was to investigate current record-keeping practices by looking at whether out-patient communication pathways to general practitioners, from letter dictation to insertion in the chart, were being satisfied. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: From current out-patient attendees over six months, 100 charts were chosen randomly, and reviewed. A pro-forma was used to collect data and this information was also checked against electronic records. FINDINGS: Of the charts reviewed, 15 per cent had no letter. If one considers that one-month is an acceptable time for letters to be inserted into the chart, then only 11 per cent satisfied this condition. Electronic data were also missing. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: It is impossible to discern whether letters to GPs were dictated by the out-patient doctor for each patient reviewed. Another limitation was that some multidisciplinary hospital teams have different out-patient note-keeping procedures, which makes some findings difficult to interpret. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The review drew attention to current record-keeping discrepancies, highlighting the need for medical record-keeping procedures and polices to be put in place. Also brought to light was the importance of providing a workforce sufficient to meet the out-patient team's administrative needs. An extended audit of other medical record-keeping aspects should be carried out to determine whether problems occur in other areas. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The study highlights the importance of establishing agreed policies and procedures for out-patient record keeping and the need to have a checking mechanism to identify system weaknesses.",nocancer"Private healthcare quality: applying a SERVQUAL model. PURPOSE: This paper seeks to develop and test the SERVQUAL model scale for measuring Malaysian private health service quality. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The study consists of 340 randomly selected participants visiting a private healthcare facility during a three-month data collection period. Data were analyzed using means, correlations, principal component and confirmatory factor analysis to establish the modified SERVQUAL scale's reliability, underlying dimensionality and convergent, discriminant validity. FINDINGS: Results indicate a moderate negative quality gap for overall Malaysian private healthcare service quality. Results also indicate a moderate negative quality gap on each service quality scale dimension. However, scale development analysis yielded excellent results, which can be used in wider healthcare policy and practice. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Respondents were skewed towards a younger population, causing concern that the results might not represent all Malaysian age groups. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The study's major contribution is that it offers a way to assess private healthcare service quality. Second, it successfully develops a scale that can be used to measure health service quality in Malaysian contexts.",nocancer"Drug dispensing and information giving in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to examine drug dispensing and associated activity in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The paper aims to describe factors associated with patient information giving and dispensing time. DESIGN/METHODOLOGYLAPPROACH: A specific protocol for recording data gathered from observations included: number of dispensing sessions; medical specialties active at the time; medication number and type; dispensing outcome; if information giving was observed and dispensing time. Information giving and time were considered response variables. The chi-square test and odds-ratios were used to verify associations between response and explanatory variables. FINDINGS: In 43 percent (45) consultations, information giving accompanied dispensing and was associated with number of dispensing sessions and medical specialty offered on a particular day. Assistance time was associated with drug type and number, which increased as dispensing sessions decreased. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: Seasonal variations in the demand for pharmacy assistance were not investigated and sample size precluded multivariate analyses. Consequently, new studies may deepen understanding about communication between physicians, pharmacy assistants and users. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Pharmacy staff could improve quality and efficiency if two aspects were taken into account: fluctuating workload, and external conditions within which tasks are undertaken. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The paper identifies external conditions that interfere with drug dispensing.",nocancer"Supply chain dynamics in healthcare services. PURPOSE: The purpose of this paper is to analyse health service supply chain systems. A great deal of literature is available on supply chain management in finished goods inventory situations; however, little research exists on managing service capacity when finished goods inventories are absent. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: System dynamics models for a typical service-oriented supply chain such as healthcare processes are developed, wherein three service stages are presented sequentially. FINDINGS: Just like supply chains with finished goods inventory, healthcare service supply chains also show dynamic behaviour. Comparing options, service reduction, and capacity adjustment delays showed that reducing capacity adjustment and service delays gives better results. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The study is confined to health service-oriented supply chains. Further work includes extending the study to service-oriented supply chains with parallel processing, i.e. having more than one stage to perform a similar operation and also to study the behaviour in service-oriented supply chains that have re-entrant orders and applications. Specific case studies can also be developed to reveal factors relevant to particular service-oriented supply chains. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: The paper explains the bullwhip effect in healthcare service-oriented supply chains. Reducing stages and capacity adjustment are strategic options for service-oriented supply chains. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The paper throws light on policy options for managing healthcare service-oriented supply chain dynamics.",nocancer"Mapping dental establishments in Massachusetts just before the recession. Bureau data indicate a continuing national increase in the number and size of dental establishments in the time just prior to the recent recession. During this same period in Massachusetts, there were marked increases in the number of individuals employed in dental facilities, and there was a combination of a minor increase of the population and limited proportional increase in the numbers of dentists and dental establishments. This resulted in small changes in population-to-dental facility ratios in most counties in the state. The usual favorable expectations of an economic upswing after a recession for dental establishments may need to be tempered given the increased overhead costs resulting from increased numbers of employees and the fact that the state has the highest dentist-to-population ratio in the country.",nocancer"Food effect on the pharmacokinetics of entecavir from dispersible tablets following oral administration in healthy Chinese volunteers. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of entecavir (CAS 142217-69-4) from dispersible tablets. METHODS: In an open-label, two-way crossover study, 12 healthy Chinese volunteers randomly received a single oral dose of 1 mg entecavir dispersible tablets under fasted and fed conditions. Blood samples were collected and determined for pharmacokinetic analyses. A solid phase extraction for sample preparation and a LC/MS method were developed and validated for determination of entecavir in human plasma. RESULTS: The absorption of entecavir from dispersible tablets was altered significantly with food intake, as evidenced by a decrease in Cm,, of 63%, a decrease in AUC0-t of 22%, and a delay in Tmax of 1.5 h. The calibration curve was linear from 0.2 to 25 ng/mL, with a lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.2 ng/mL. CONCLUSION: Food intake has an obvious effect on the absorption of entecavir from dispersible tablets. It is better to take entecavir dispersible tablets on an empty stomach.",nocancer"Influence of pre-analytical conditions on plasma ribavirin concentrations. Ribavirin (CAS 66510-90-5) associated to peginterferon (CAS 99210-65-8) is the current standard treatment for chronic hepatitis C. Exposure to ribavirin influences the virological response and anemia. Therefore monitoring plasma concentration of ribavirin is a useful tool for individualizing ribavirin dosing regimens. Ribavirin is a substrate of several nucleoside transporters that play a role in its distribution in erythrocytes. After blood sampling, it is essential to limit this mechanism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of temperature and time on ribavirin plasma concentrations. Two blood samples, collected in EDTA tubes, were taken at the same time from 23 patients. One sample was conserved on ice whereas the second one was kept at room temperature during transport to the laboratory. Upon receipt at the laboratory and at different times post-reception (from 1 to 3 h), 1.5 mL of blood from each sample was centrifuged to obtain plasma that was then stored at -20 degrees C until assay. Samples were maintained in the same conditions as during transport for the 3 h. Plasma ribavirin was analysed using an HPLC-UV system. The results showed that mean loss of ribavirin concentration, for samples kept on ice as well as at room temperature, was less than 3%, 9% and 13% after 1, 2 and 3 h, respectively. These results suggest that blood samples for ribavirin analysis can be sent at room temperature within a period of 2 h between sampling and centrifugation.",nocancer"Antioxidative effects of thiazide diuretics in refractory hypertensive patients. A randomized crossover trial of chlortalidone and trichlormethiazide. Some thiazide diuretics seem to exert antioxidant effects, which may be beneficial in the management of hypertension. Although many large-scale clinical trials on hypertension have proved that thiazide diuretics confer significant reductions in stroke and cardiovascular events, most of these trials preferentially used chlortalidone. Therefore, the difference in antioxidant effects between chlortalidone (CAS 77-36-1; 12.5 mg/day) and another thiazide diuretic, trichlormethiazide (CAS 133-67-5; 1 mg/day) was studied. Forty patients with refractory hypertension even after treatment with a combination of a calcium channel blocker and an angiotensin II receptor blocker were randomly assigned to additionally receive either chlortalidone or trichlormethiazide for 6 months. Then, diuretics were switched in each patient and they were treated for another 6 months. Ambulatory blood pressure was monitored for 24 h and markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein) and oxidative stress (8-isoprostane, malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoproteins) were measured before and after each treatment. Addition of chlortalidone resulted in a greater reduction of blood pressure (mean of 24 h; from 146.8 +/- 18.0/83.8 +/- 12.2 mmHg to 122 +/- 18/72 +/- 11 mmHg) than that of trichlormethiazide (134 +/- 18/ 78 +/- 11 mmHg, p < 0.001). The levels of C-reactive protein, malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoproteins, and 8-isoprostane were lower after chlortalidone therapy than after trichlormethiazide therapy. These results suggest that chlortalidone is superior to trichlormethiazide in patients with essential hypertension.",nocancer"Single dose bioequivalence study of alpha-methyldopa tablet formulations using a modified HPLC method. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to compare the bioavailability of a new methyldopa (CAS 555-30-6) tablet formulation with that of a reference formulation in 12 healthy male subjects using a modified HPLC method. METHODS: The study was designed as an open label, single-dose, randomized study with a cross-over design. Under fasting conditions, each subject received one 250-mg tablet orally as a single dose of a test or reference formulation on two treatment days. The treatment periods were separated by a one-week washout period. The blood samples were collected at different time points after each administration and determined using a rapid and reliable modified HPLC method. The method used was validated for specificity, accuracy, precision and sensitivity. The pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax, AUC0-t, AUC0-infinity) were statistically compared by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for test and reference formulations. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: All validation criteria for the developed HPLC method were in acceptable range. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of alpha-methyldopa was 270.3-1864.9 ng/ml for the test and 224.5-1585.6 ng/ml for the reference formulation. The mean AUC0-infinity of alpha-methyldopa was 2002.1-10614.8 and 2076.8- 9056.3 ng x h/ml for the test and reference formulation, respectively. The calculated 90% confidence intervals for the mean test/reference ratios of mentioned parameters were 92.48-115.94, and 88.82-101.13 which are in the bioequivalence range. The statistical tests did not show any statistical differences between formulations suggesting that methyldopa tablet of test and reference can be considered as bioequivalent preparations. CONCLUSION: A rapid and reliable HPLC method with fluorescence detector was developed to analyze alpha-methyldopa in human plasma. Based on the obtained results the test formulation of alpha-methyldopa is bioequivalent to the reference formulation.",nocancer"A sensitive and selective HPLC method for estimation of lamotrigine in human plasma and saliva: application to plasma-saliva correlation in epileptic patients. A sensitive and selective high performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed and validated for estimation of lamotrigine (CAS 84057-84-1) in human plasma and saliva. The chromatographic separation was achieved with a reversed phase column and a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile and 20 mM ammonium acetate buffer pH 6.5 (30:70) with a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The calibration curve was linear within the working range for both plasma and saliva. The validated method has been successfully applied for a study of lamotrigine in human plasma and saliva to establish the correlation between these two matrices. A scatter plot of plasma versus salivary lamotrigine concentrations showed a gold linear relationship between them (Pearson correlation coefficient, r = 0.6832, p < 0.001).",nocancer"Enigmatic lipoprotein (a) and cardiovascular disease. Lipoprotein (a), (LPA) consists of a low density lipoprotein (LDL)-like particle with a lipid core encircled by a large protein, the apo-B-100. A very large glycoprotein, the apoprotein (a) (apoA) is firmly linked to apo-B-100 by two covalent disulfide bonds. The metabolic role of LPA until very recently has been shrouded in mystery. Individuals who have no LPA or a very low level are not known to be affected with any specific disorder. Naturally, this does not mean that LPA above normal is likewise without clinical impact. Elevated LPA is a well known risk factor for atherosclerosis. Amount of LPA in the organism is genetically determined and it is also because of this that medical intervention has not been very successful in modifying this prominent risk metabolite (Fig. 3, Tab. 1, Ref. 37).",nocancer"C-2 anterior plate-screw fixation: a quantitative anatomical and morphometric evaluation. OBJECTIVES: Discectomy and inter-vertebral body fusion combined with the anterior plate-screw fixa tion is the common procedure in cervical spine surgery. But the anterior plate-screw fixation of the C2 spine has been the uncommon surgical procedure. In this study, we analyze the anatomy of the C2 body relevant to C2 anterior plate-screw fixation. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighty-six dried C2 spines were evaluated directly for this study. Measurements were made on the C2 body width and midsagittal anteroposterior (AP) depth and the anteroposterior parasagittal depth 5 mm lateral to midline on the inferior endplates, in addition to on the middle body. Measurements also were made of anteroposterior parasagittal vertebral depth with both medial and lateral inclination of 10 degrees, with respect to the parasagittal plane of the vertebral body. RESULTS: The ideal maximum screw length and trajectory was found to be AP medial parasagittal depth of inferior surface of the C2 body [Right: 13.7 +/- 1.4 mm (11.0-17.9), Left: 13.6 +/- 1.5 mm (10.7-17.8)]. CONCLUSIONS: We report the measurements of the vertebral body of the C2. We think these measurements provide guidelines for operating on the anterior C2 spine, and enhance the confidence interval for the surgeon (Tab. 3, Fig. 1, Ref. 24).",nocancer"Atlanto-occipital fusion: an osteological study with clinical implications. BACKGROUND: Atlanto-occipital fusion may be symptomatic or asymptomatic in nature. The anomaly may be incidentally detected at autopsies or during routine cadaveric dissections. The fusion of the atlas with occipital bone may result in the compression of vertebral artery and first cervical nerve. METHODS: A total of 55 dried occipital bones in the Department of Anatomy, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) and Department of Anatomy, Universiti Malaya (UM) were included in the study. The presence of atlantooccipital fusion was closely observed and morphometric measurements were taken. RESULTS: Out of 55 dried occipital bones studied, we observed atlanto-occiptalization in two bones (3.63 %). A total of 53 occipital bones (96.37 %) did not exhibit any anomalous fusions. Out of the two anomalous atlanto-occiptal fusions, one was complete while the other had unilateral right-sided fusion of the atlas with the occipital bone. CONCLUSION: Atlanto-occipitalization may result in the compression of vertebral artery thereby influencing the blood flow to the brain. Atlanto-occipitalization may also result in compression of the first cervical nerve. The action of the postural muscles on the extensor surface may be affected as a result of this anomaly. The present article discusses the clinical implications of atlanto-occipitalization, which may be beneficial for neurosurgeons, neurologists and radiologists in day-to-day clinical practice (Fig. 3, Ref. 17).",nocancer"Thymic Hassall's bodies of children with congenital heart defects. The development of the thymus and heart are closely related while in both, the neural crest cells play an important role. In our preliminary study, the thymic microscopic structures of the infant's thymuses with the congenital heart defects were observed. The study was conducted on 36 specimens of newborn thymuses removed due to surgery for cardiovascular malformations. Standard formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue technique was used. Five-microm-thick sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and the microscopic examination was focused on the structure of Hassall's bodies. The Hassall's bodies showed considerable variations in size as well as in quantity. In most cases, the Hassall's bodies were large with the heterogeneous amorphous material enclosed in cystic dilatations. This type of Hassall's bodies is typical for adult thymuses. The most conspicuous changes (huge Hassall's bodies with the cystic dilatation filled up with cell detritus) were observed in patients with ventricular septal defect, atrioventricular septal defect and tetralogy of Fallot. Small-sized Hassall's bodies corresponding with infant age, were observed in cases with pulmonary valve atresia, atrial septal defect and in some cases of transposition of great arteries. We assume that the changes of microenvironment of the thymic medulla are associated with disrupted migration of the neural crest cells which are essential in the normogenesis of both heart and thymus (Tab. 1, Fig. 12, Ref. 33).",nocancer"Conventional physical therapy with lumbar traction; clinical evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging for lumbar disc herniation. OBJECTIVE: This study measures and compares the outcome of conservative physical therapy with traction, by using magnetic resonance imaging and clinical parameters in patients presenting with low back pain caused by lumbar disc herniation. METHODS: A total of 26 patients with LDH (14F, 12M with mean aged 37 +/- 11) were enrolled in this study and 15 sessions (per day on 3 weeks) of physical therapy were applied. That included hot pack, ultrasound, electrotherapy and lumbar traction. Physical examination of the lumbar spine, severity of pain, sleeping order, patient and physician global assessment with visual analogue scale, functional disability by HAQ, Roland Disability Questionnaire, and Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire were assessed at baseline and at 4-6 weeks after treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging examinations were carried out before and 4-6 weeks after the treatment RESULTS: All patients completed the therapy session. There were significant reductions in pain, sleeping disturbances, patient and physician global assessment and disability scores, and significant increases in lumbar movements between baseline and follow-up periods. There were significant reductions of size of the herniated mass in five patients, and significant increase in 3 patients on magnetic resonance imaging after treatment, but no differences in other patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that conventional physical therapies with lumbar traction were effective in the treatment of patient with subacute LDH. These results suggest that clinical improvement is not correlated with the finding of MRI. Patients with LDH should be monitored clinically (Fig. 3, Ref. 18).",nocancer"Costs related to medical treatment for common cardiovascular risk factors. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the direct and indirect costs of selected cardiovascular diseases, namely hypertension (HT), metabolic syndrome (MS) and diabetes mellitus (DM) in the Slovak Republic. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study analyzes the data of 1,000 patients, randomly selected from NEMESYS database (10,300 patients). Average direct pharmacotherapeutic costs of hypertension per year were 257 Euros in men and 264 Euros in women. Costs of metabolic syndrome were 334 Euros in men and 321 Euros in women. Finally, the costs of diabetes mellitus were 392 Euros in men and 384 Euros in women. The most expensive pharmacotherapy was used in patients with a combination of all three diagnoses (HT+MS+DM), namely 452 Euros in men and 455 Euros in women. Indirect costs represent an even more serious financial burden. The highest indirect costs were in patients with diabetes mellitus, namely 5,227 Euros in men and 5,365 Euros in women. CONCLUSIONS: The study proved the assumption of increasing the direct pharmacotherapeutic costs in correlation with the increased severity of disease. The gender differences on the other hand, were smaller in patients with more serious conditions. The indirect costs represented the greatest financial burden, and were 13 to 17 times higher than the direct pharmacotherapeutic costs (Tab. 4, Ref. 17).",nocancer"HSP60, oxidative stress parameters and cardiometabolic risk markers in hypertensive and normotensive Slovak females. BACKGROUND: The aim of our study was to analyse the relationships between hypertension, HSP60, oxidative stress, lipid profile and cardiometabolic risk in 126 females with arterial hypertension (AHW) and 39 normotensive females (AH-). RESULTS: Females with AH+ were significantly older and more frequently suffered from ischemic heart disease, angina pectoris, prior MI, abdominal obesity, obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. On the other hand, normotensive females smoked significantly more often. Plasma levels of HSP60 were similar in both AH+ and AH- groups. However, hypertensive females exhibited almost two times lower values of oxidative glutation and lower levels of carbonyl protein, but significantly higher levels of homocysteine. In normotensive females, the total glutathione was the only parameter predicting females with the plasma level of HSP60 = 60 ng/ml. The independent predictors in hypertensive females were angina pectoris, triglycerides and the mean arterial pressure (MAP). MAP had also a borderline significance in normotensive females suggesting an association between HSP60 and blood pressure. MAP formed a J shaped curve with HSP60. CONCLUSION: Results suggest the association of blood pressure and heart shock protein 60 Kda in form of the J curve (Tab. 11, Fig. 3, Ref. 29).",nocancer"Multiple dens evaginatus of premolars and molars in Chinese dentition: a case report and literature review. Dens evaginatus (DE) is a dental anomaly that occurs as an accessory tubercle on the occlusal or lingual surface of a tooth. The authors provide a literature review and report a rare case in which DE occurs on multiple mandibular premolars and maxillary molars. The patient is a 26-year-old Chinese woman, with a chief complaint of gingival bleeding. DE affecting teeth 17, 27, 35, and 45 was found during clinical examination. For treatment of the patient, we reduced the opposing occluding teeth, while undertaking progressive grinding of the tubercles for six months. We followed-up for a year. This suggests the importance of examining for multiple DE during clinical practice.",nocancer"China's oral care system in transition: lessons to be learned from Germany. AIM: The objective of this discussion paper is to investigate whether the experience gained through the German paradigm shift in dental care can be of benefit in China's deliberations on the introduction of universal dental care for its people. METHODOLOGY A comparison of representative oral health outcome data from China and Germany, two countries at different stages in their development, is presented here in order to analyse whether the findings meet expected outcome and confirm the presumption that more developed countries perform better. RESULTS: The epidemiological comparison reveals surprising findings concerning the severity of dental diseases and, in particular, missing teeth per person in adults and rates of total edentulousness in seniors. In all of these areas German adults and seniors show significantly inferior outcomes compared with the Chinese population. The main reason for these striking discrepancies, as it turned out, is the decisive role played by the treatment philosophies and strategies of German dentists. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: If dentists take a less interventionist approach, checking as well as treating dental diseases with preventive and strictly tooth-preserving methods, dental treatment results in oral health. Under these conditions it can be assumed that modern dentistry is generally good for the teeth. These findings are important for developing countries that are seeking to integrate dental care into their health care system. On the basis of long-term experience from highly industrialized Western countries and especially from Germany we will attempt to put forward proposals for creating an effective and efficient dental care system in China.",nocancer"Factors influencing subjective orthodontic treatment need and culture-related differences among Chinese natives and foreign inhabitants. AIM: The aim of this survey was to compare Chinese natives and foreign inhabitants in Chengdu, China, with respect to: (1) attitudes towards dental appearance, (2) subjective orthodontic treatment need, and (3) the main factors influencing orthodontic treatment need. METHODOLOGY: A total of 522 subjects, including 227 foreign inhabitants and 295 Chinese natives in Chengdu participated in the survey. A simple random sampling method was adopted and a face-to-face interview was conducted at some public sites using a questionnaire. Data was entered by two persons synchronously using Epidata 3.0, and SPSS 13.0 was used to analyze these data. RESULTS: 89.0% of foreign inhabitants were satisfied with their teeth compared to only 46.8% of Chinese natives. Females were more dissatisfied with their teeth than males. Chinese natives put improving appearance as the top priority (55.9%) for seeking orthodontic treatment; however, in foreign inhabitants, the main reason for seeking treatment was to improve masticatory function (44.1%), followed by ""to be pretty"" (35.2%). The importance of well-aligned teeth and self-perception of psychosocial impact of malocclusion were the same two main factors influencing subjective orthodontic treatment need (P < 0.05) in foreign inhabitants and Chinese natives. Subjective orthodontic treatment need between the two target groups was significantly different (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: (1) It was very common that Chinese natives were dissatisfied with their dental appearance, and their subjective orthodontic treatment needs were high. (2) There were some differences in orthodontic treatment motives between the two target groups. (3) There were differences in subjective orthodontic treatment needs between foreign inhabitants and Chinese natives. However, the prominent influential factors were almost the same. There may be benefit to understanding subjective orthodontic needs of different races.",nocancer"The use of zein and Shuanghuangbu for periodontal tissue engineering. AIM: Tissue engineering is a promising area with a broad range of applications in the fields of regenerative medicine and human health. The emergence of periodontal tissue engineering for clinical treatment of periodontal disease has opened a new therapeutic avenue. The choice of scaffold is crucial. This study was conducted to prepare zein scaffold and explore the suitability of zein and Shuanghuangbu for periodontal tissue engineering. METHODOLOGY: A zein scaffold was made using the solvent casting/particulate leaching method with sodium chloride (NaCl) particles as the porogen. The physical properties of the zein scaffold were evaluated by observing its shape and determining its pore structure and porosity. Cytotoxicity testing of the scaffold was carried out via in vitro cell culture experiments, including a liquid extraction experiment and the direct contact assay. Also, the Chinese medicine Shuanghuangbu, as a growth factor, was diluted by scaffold extract into different concentrations. This Shuanghuangbu-scaffold extract was then added to periodontal ligament cells (PDLCs) in order to determine its effect on cell proliferation. RESULTS: The zein scaffold displayed a sponge-like structure with a high porosity and sufficient thickness. The porosity and pore size of the zein scaffold can be controlled by changing the porogen particles dosage and size. The porosity was up to 64.1%-78.0%. The pores were well-distributed, interconnected, and porous. The toxicity of the zein scaffold was graded as 0-1. Furthermore, PDLCs displayed full stretching and vigorous growth under scanning electronic microscope (SEM). Shuanghuangbu-scaffold extract could reinforce proliferation activity of PDLCs compared to the control group, especially at 100 microg x mL(-1) (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: A zein scaffold with high porosity, open pore wall structure, and good biocompatibility is conducive to the growth of PDLCs. Zein could be used as scaffold to repair periodontal tissue defects. Also, Shuanghuangbu-scaffold extract can enhance the proliferation activity of PDLCs. Altogether, these findings provide the basis for in vivo testing on animals.",nocancer"Malonylcarnitine in newborns with non-syndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate. AIM: Malonyl-CoA is regarded as a key signaling molecule in mammalian cells. It is converted to acetyl-CoA, and to a lesser extent, to malonyl acid and malonylcarnitine (C3DC). Availability of carnitine has been reported to be essential for the developing fetus. The objectives of the present study were to analyze associations of malonylcarnitine, acetylcarnitine (C2), and free carnitine (CO) in subjects with orofacial clefts. METHODOLOGY: We performed a retrospective analysis of carnitine concentration obtained from a newborn screening program carried out in our institution. Concentrations of whole blood malonylcarnitine, acetylcarnitine, and free carnitine were measured using tandem mass spectrometry. The study group consisted of 51 children with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate. In total, 106 healthy children without congenital anomalies served as controls. Cut-off points were established using likelihood ratio values. RESULTS: The mean concentration of malonylcarnitine in the cleft group was lower than that of the control group, 0.048 micromol x L(-1) vs. 0.058 micromol x L(-1), respectively (P = 0.009). In patients with orofacial cleft, low malonylcarnitine levels (< or = 0.047 micromol x L(-1)) were 1.7 times more predominant than in healthy individuals (P = -0.03). The mean concentration of acetylcarnitine was also lower in affected newborns in comparison to controls, 33.8 micromol x L(-1) vs. 37.8 micromol x L(-1), respectively (P = 0.026). After analysis of acetylcarnitine and free carnitine concentrations, the likelihood ratio test did not indicate valuable cut-offpoints. CONCLUSION: The study provides initial data indicating a potential association between decreased malonylcarnitine and abnormal palatogenesis.",nocancer"Clonal characterization of bone marrow derived stem cells and their application for bone regeneration. Tissue engineering allows the design of functionally active cells within supportive bio-scaffolds to promote the development of new tissues such as cartilage and bone for the restoration of pathologically altered tissues. However, all bone tissue engineering applications are limited by a shortage of stem cells. The adult bone marrow stroma contains a subset of nonhematopoietic cells referred to as bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). BMSCs are of interest because they are easily isolated from a small aspirate of bone marrow and readily generate single-cell-derived colonies. These cells have the capacity to undergo extensive replication in an undifferentiated state ex vivo. In addition, BMSCs have the potential to develop either in vitro or in vivo into distinct mesenchymal tissues, including bone, cartilage, fat, tendon, muscle, and marrow stroma. Thus, BMSCs are an attractive cell source for tissue engineering approaches. However, BMSCs are not homogeneous and the quantity of stem cells decreases in the bone marrow in aged population. A sequential loss of lineage differentiation potential has been found in the mixed culture of bone marrow stromal cells due to a heterogenous population. Therefore, a number of studies have proposed that homogenous bone marrow stem cells can be generated from clonal culture of bone marrow cells and that BMSC clones have the greatest potential for the application of bone regeneration in vivo.",nocancer"Salivary gland branching morphogenesis--recent progress and future opportunities. Salivary glands provide saliva to maintain oral health, and a loss of salivary gland function substantially decreases quality-of-life. Understanding the biological mechanisms that generate salivary glands during embryonic development may identify novel ways to regenerate function or design artificial salivary glands. This review article summarizes current research on the process of branching morphogenesis of salivary glands, which creates gland structure during development. We highlight exciting new advances and opportunities in studies of cell-cell interactions, mechanical forces, growth factors, and gene expression patterns to improve our understanding of this important process.",nocancer"Cerebellar ataxia following snake bite.

Focal neurological symptoms may provide the first clue to the presence of nonketotic hyperglycemia (NKH). We report a patient with hemichorea-hemiballism (HC-HB) as the first manifestation of NKH. CT Brain revealed hyperdensity in bilateral globus pallidus (GP) and putamen predominantly on right side. Blood sugar was 580 mg/dl and s. osmolality was 316 mosm/l. This condition resolved after correction of hyperglycemia. The possible mechanism by which NKH causes this condition is discussed.,nocancer"Pyoderma gangrenosum. Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an idiopathic, ulcerative, noninfective chronic inflammatory skin disorder of unknown etiology. It is associated with systemic medical illness in 50% of cases like inflammatory bowel disease, systemic arthritis, haematological diseases and malignancies. Characteristic lesions begin as pustule or vesiculopustule and progresses to an ulcer or deep erosion with violaceous overhanging or undermined borders. Diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum is clinical and depends on exclusion of other causes of cutaneous ulceration. The management of PG is treatment of underlying systemic medical illness and judicious use of immunosuppressants. Association of PG with these medical illnesses and treatment with immunosuppressants make the clinical utility for internists, gastroenterologists, haematologists and rheumatologists.",nocancer"Morphologic and body composition changes are different in men and women on generic combination antiretroviral therapy--an observational study. BACKGROUND: Increasingly effective therapies for HIV infection, combination antiretroviral therapy, are now widely available in developing countries. A range of metabolic complications presenting as abnormalities of body-fat mass distribution in association with dyslipidemia and glucose homeostasis dysregulation, have been recognized as important toxicities in patients treated with these drugs. With increasing use of antiretroviral therapy in India, we examined the association between gender and body shape and composition, one year after initiating combination antiretroviral therapy and attempted to identify simple clinical markers to detect and monitor these changes. METHODS: Patients on combination antiretroviral therapy (2 NRTIs + 1 NNRTI), attending a HIV clinic between July 2005 and December 2006 had anthropometry clinical examination and bioelectric impedance analysis (BIA) performed along with blood tests at baseline and after 1 year. RESULTS: Of the 34 patients on combination antiretroviral therapy, 5 males and 12 females had noticeable changes in their body shape. Significant decrease in triceps skin fold thickness, an increase in waist circumference and waist: hip ratio was observed in females. BIA did not show any change in total body fat in either sex. CONCLUSIONS: Since the presence and severity of fat redistribution could affect adherence as well as the success of antiretroviral therapy, close monitoring is required to detect and prevent this complication early.",nocancer"Giant cell arteritis in Mumbai. OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical profile of patients with giant cell arteritis in Mumbai. METHODS: From our database, patients with a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA) over a fifteen year period (January 1990 to December 2005) were included. Clinical manifestations, temporal artery biopsy, treatment, and follow-up data of these patients were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty one patients with GCA were identified. However, data were available only for 16 patients. The median age was 66.5 years (58-78 yrs) with male to female ratio of 1:1. The mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 5.18 months (0.5-24 months). Clinical manifestations included new onset headache (15), fever (9), weight loss (9), jaw claudication (9), polymyalgia rheumatica (5), visual disturbances (3), scalp nodule (1), temporal artery tenderness (11), tortuosity (9), and scalp tenderness (6). ESR was elevated in 15 patients with a median of 106.5 mm at 1 hr (25-135 mm/hr). Temporal artery biopsy was done in 11 patients and confirmed the diagnosis in 10 patients. Color doppler study of the temporal arteries (9 patients) revealed halo sign (indicating arterial wall edema) in 6 patients. Biopsy as per site by color doppler study was performed in 6 of these patients and was positive in 5. All patients had a good initial response to steroids, however, on follow up, 3 patients required addition of methotrexate. At a median follow up (n = 14) of 6 months (range 6-156), steroids were successfully stopped in 7 patients at 1 to 3 years interval. The disease relapsed in 1 patient. Of the remaining 7 patients, 2 were steroid dependent and 5 patients were doing well on low dose prednisolone. CONCLUSION: GCA, though uncommon in India, should be suspected in all elderly patients with a new onset headache, fever, jaw claudication, or high ESR. Color doppler sonography is a useful noninvasive method for the diagnosis of GCA and also helps to identify the site to biopsy. Most respond to steroid therapy while some need addition of steroid sparing agents.",nocancer"The metabolic syndrome and associated risk factors in an urban industrial male population in South India. BACKGROUND: The metabolic syndrome is characterized by clustering of risk factors, which predisposes subjects to increased risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Objectives of this study were to estimate prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and determine the association of risk factors with the metabolic syndrome in an urban industrial male population in Chennai, India. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey for male employees working in an industrial unit. The survey included questionnaire for risk factors, anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. Blood samples were collected for the fasting plasma glucose, serum cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. The metabolic syndrome was defined using International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and American Heart Association (AHA)/National Heart Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) criteria. RESULTS: The total numbers of male subjects included in the study were 1077. The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was 41.3% and 51.4% using IDF and AHA/NHLBI criteria respectively. Risk factors were age above 35 years, family history of diabetes and body mass index (BMI) above 23.9 kg/m2. The consumption of more than three servings of fruits and vegetables was protective. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was very high in select industrial population in south India. Higher BMI and low intake of fruits and vegetables are modifiable by life style modification. Work site screening for the metabolic syndrome would facilitate the early detection and treatment.",nocancer"Birth control necessary to limit family size in tribal couples with aberrant heterosis of G-6-PD deficiency and sickle cell disorders in India: an urgency of creating awareness and imparting genetic counseling. OBJECTIVES: (i) To study the outcome of ignorance and lack of awareness about sickle cell disease and G-6-PD deficiency among Dhelki Kharia tribal families of Orissa, and (ii) to study the reproductive output in relation to clinical genetics and patho-physiological implications. METHODOLOGY: A random genetic study of screening for hemoglobinopathies and G-6-PD deficiency among Dhelki Kharia tribal community in Sundargarh district of Orissa was carried out for intervention during the year 2000-2004. A total of 81 Dhelki Kharia families were screened and six families with double heterozygosity for above genetic anomalies were encountered. About 2-3 ml. intravenous blood samples were collected in EDTA by disposable syringes and needles after taking informed consent from each individual in the presence of a doctor and community leaders and sent to laboratory at Bhubaneswar for hematological investigations. Analysis was carried out following the standard procedures after cross checking for quality control. RESULTS: There were 12 (about 52%) children out of 23 who were either suffering from sickle cell trait or disease in concurrence with G-6-PD deficiency in hemizygous/heterozygous/homozygous condition in Dhelki Kharia tribal community of Orissa. There were on an average 3.83 number of surviving (range 2-6) children per mother in families of G-6-PD deficiency and sickle cell disorders. The average number of children (3.83) born (range 2-6 children) per mother to carrier/affected mother was much higher than the average for India (2.73). CONCLUSIONS: It is very difficult to maintain the normal health of an affected child with aberrant anomalies due to exorbitant cost of treatment, frequent transfusions and huge involvement of economy. One of the implications of aberrant heterosis is its adverse affects on routine individual physiology and hard activities. It is suggested to limit the family size in carrier couples to avoid aberrant heterosis of hereditary hemolytic disorders in their offsprings.",nocancer"Profile of patients of leptospirosis in sub-Himalayan region of North India. CONTEXT: Leptospirosis is an emerging zoonosis world wide; it is being reported in many areas of south-east Asia now. A recent surge in the number of patients with leptospirosis has been noted in the Sub-Himalayan region of North India which was uncommon. We present here a case series of 13 patients who were positive for leptospirosis either by IgM Elisa or PCR method. AIMS: To study the profile of leptospirosis in a sub-Himalayan state of North India i.e. Himachal Pradesh. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of leptospira positive patients who were admitted in IGMC, Shimla. The study was conducted in Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla situated at a moderate altitude in North India. METHODS AND MATERIAL: All patients presenting in Medical College Hospital during three months from 1st August to 31st October who tested IgM positive or borderline or PCR positive for leptospirosis were taken into the study. Their presenting complaints, examination findings and lab findings were recorded and analyzed based on the Faine's criteria and modified Faine's criteria. Patients with clinical features of Leptospirosis and who tested positive for IgM Leptospirosis were taken as IgM lepto can be falsely positive. RESULTS: Out of total 13 patients there were 3 males and 10 females, age range was from 24 to 78 yrs and mean was 44 yrs. Predominant complaints were fever, jaundice, myalgia, and headache. All had contact with animals or contaminated environment. LFT's were deranged in 12 and renal functions were deranged in all. Ten had positive results for IgM against leptospira while 2 had borderline positive result. One patient was positive by PCR method using G1, G2 primers. Ten patients had Weil's syndrome and this was the main presentation of leptospirosis in our group, one had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and needed ventilator. There were no deaths. All responded to injectable ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline. Applying Faine's criteria only 7 were positive, but using modified Faine's criteria all 13 were positive for leptospirosis. CONCLUSIONS: Leptospirosis was unexpectedly found to be positive in many of our patients who were having pyrexia during the monsoons. A recent surge has been noted in the number of cases with leptospirosis in this state. The possibility of co-infection especially with scrub typhus must be considered in cases with atypical presentation and severe illness. Most of the patients were from rural background with poor hygienic conditions. There was no mortality and main complication was Weil's syndrome in 77 percent.",nocancer"Vital signs: HIV testing and diagnosis among adults--United States, 2001-2009. BACKGROUND: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and health-care expenditures in the United States. HIV testing and linkage to care are essential to identify persons early in their course of infection to prevent progression to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and death, and to reduce transmission. METHODS: CDC used 2001-2009 data from the National Health Interview Survey to estimate percentages of persons aged 18--64 years who reported ever being tested for HIV in the United States. Data from the National HIV Surveillance System were used to estimate numbers, percentages, and rates of HIV diagnoses, AIDS diagnoses, and late diagnoses of HIV infection (defined as an AIDS diagnosis made <12 months from an initial HIV diagnosis) for persons diagnosed with HIV infection during 2001--2008 and reported to CDC through June 2009; these were used to determine populations and regions most affected by HIV and AIDS, late diagnoses, and trends in late diagnoses over time. RESULTS: The percentage of persons aged 18-64 years ever tested for HIV was stable at approximately 40% from 2001 to 2006, increasing to 45.0% in 2009. The percentage of persons with late diagnoses of HIV infection was stable at approximately 37% from 2001 to 2004, decreasing to 32.3% by 2007 (most recent data available). In the 37 states with mature HIV reporting systems in 2007, the percentage of persons diagnosed late ranged from 25.0% to 47.2%. In 2008, most HIV diagnoses, by race/ethnicity, were among blacks or African Americans (51.2%) and, by transmission category, were among non-drug-injecting men reporting male-to-male sexual contact (55.0%). AIDS diagnosis rates were highest in the South and Northeast census regions and in the most populated states. CONCLUSIONS: The number of persons in the United States who report ever being tested for HIV is increasing, and fewer persons are being diagnosed late in their infection. However, nearly one third of diagnoses still occur late. Increased testing efforts are needed, particularly among populations that account for most HIV diagnoses. IMPLICATIONS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH PRACTICE: All health-care providers should expand routine HIV screening so that all adults are tested. Members of populations with higher rates of HIV diagnoses and living in geographic areas with high HIV prevalence should be screened more frequently than others. Persons likely to be at high risk for HIV infection (e.g., gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men) should be tested at least annually. Public health officials should emphasize the importance of HIV testing and allocate resources to increase testing among populations with the highest rates of HIV diagnoses.",nocancer"Suicides in national parks--United States, 2003-2009. In 2007, the year for which the most recent national data on fatalities are available, 34,598 suicides occurred in the United States (rate: 11.3 per 100,000 population); 79% were among males. In 2009, an estimated 374,486 visits to hospital emergency departments occurred for self-inflicted injury, of which approximately 262,000 (70%) could be attributed to suicidal behavior. The majority (58%) were among females. Most suicides (77%) occur in the home, but many occur in public places, including national parks. In addition to the loss of life, suicides consume park resources and staff time and can traumatize witnesses. To describe the characteristics of and trends in suicides in national parks, CDC and the National Park Service (NPS) analyzed reports of suicide events (suicides and attempted suicides) occurring in the parks during 2003-2009. During this 7-year span, 84 national parks reported 286 suicide events, an average of 41 events per year. Of the 286 events, 68% were fatal. The two most commonly used methods were firearms and falls. Consistent with national patterns, 83% of suicides were among males. A comprehensive, multicomponent approach is recommended to prevent suicide events, including enhanced training for park employees, site-specific barriers, and collaboration with communities.",nocancer"Seasonal influenza and 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women--10 states, 2009-10 influenza season. Because pregnant women are at increased risk for severe disease associated with influenza infection, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices have recommended seasonal influenza vaccination for women while pregnant, regardless of trimester. In 2009, a novel strain of influenza A (H1N1) virus was identified, and pregnant women also were found to be at greater risk for influenza-related complications from this new virus. As a result, during the 2009--10 influenza season, two separate influenza vaccines were recommended to pregnant women: inactivated trivalent 2009--10 seasonal vaccine and influenza A (H1N1) 2009 monovalent vaccine. To estimate influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women during the 2009--10 influenza season, CDC analyzed data from 10 states from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS). This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which determined that vaccination coverage for pregnant women among the 10 states combined was 50.7% for seasonal influenza and 46.6% for 2009 H1N1. In addition, women to whom vaccination was offered or recommended by their health-care provider were significantly more likely to report being vaccinated against seasonal influenza (relative risk [RR] = 3.3) and 2009 H1N1 (RR = 10.1). These results indicate substantially higher influenza vaccination coverage among pregnant women than has been reported for previous influenza seasons and support previous findings that receipt of influenza vaccination can be influenced greatly by health-care providers offering or recommending influenza vaccination.",nocancer"Inhibition of RIP2's tyrosine kinase activity limits NOD2-driven cytokine responses. Upon intracellular bacterial exposure, the Crohn's disease and sarcoidosis susceptibility protein NOD2 (nucleotide oligomerization domain protein 2) binds to the protein kinase RIP2 (receptor-interacting protein 2) to coordinate NF-kappaB (nuclear factor kappa B)-mediated cytokine responses. While RIP2 clearly has kinase activity, the function of its kinase domain has been enigmatic. Although originally classified as a serine-threonine kinase based on homology scans, we find that RIP2 also has tyrosine kinase activity. RIP2 undergoes autophosphorylation on Tyr 474 (Y474). This phosphorylation event is necessary for effective NOD2 signaling and does not occur in the presence of the most common Crohn's disease-associated NOD2 allele. Given this tyrosine kinase activity, a small-molecule inhibitor screen designed to identify pharmacologic agents that inhibit RIP2's tyrosine kinase activity was performed. At nanomolar concentrations, the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva) were found to inhibit both RIP2 tyrosine phosphorylation and MDP (muramyl dipeptide)-induced cytokine release in a variety of NOD2 hyperactivation states. This effect is specific for RIP2 and does not depend on EGFR. The finding that RIP2 has tyrosine kinase activity and the finding that gefitinib and erlotinib, two agents already used clinically for cancer chemotherapy, can inhibit this activity suggest that RIP2's tyrosine kinase activity could be targeted specifically in the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",nocancer"Phosphorylation of the NFAR proteins by the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase PKR constitutes a novel mechanism of translational regulation and cellular defense. Here, we describe a new mechanism of host defense that involves the nuclear factors associated with dsRNA (NFAR1 [90 kDa] and NFAR2 [110 kDa]), which constitute part of the shuttling ribonuclear protein (RNP) complex. Activation of the dsRNA-activated protein kinase PKR by viral RNA enabled phosphorylation of NFAR1 and NFAR2 on Thr 188 and Thr 315, an event found to be evolutionarily conserved in Xenopus. Phosphorylated NFAR1 and NFAR2 became dissociated from nuclear factor 45 (NF45), which was requisite for NFAR reshuttling, causing the NFARs to be retained on ribosomes, associate with viral transcripts, and impede viral replication. Cre-loxP animals with depletion of the NFARs in the thymus were exquisitely sensitive to the cytoplasmic replicating virus VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus). Thus, the NFARs constitute a novel, conserved mechanism of host defense used by the cell to detect and impede aberrant translation events.",nocancer"Constitutive mTORC1 activation by a herpesvirus Akt surrogate stimulates mRNA translation and viral replication. All viruses require cellular ribosomes to translate their mRNAs. Viruses producing methyl-7 (m(7)) GTP-capped mRNAs, like Herpes Simplex Virus-1 (HSV-1), stimulate cap-dependent translation by activating mTORC1 to inhibit the translational repressor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1). Here, we establish that the HSV-1 kinase Us3 masquerades as Akt to activate mTORC1. Remarkably, Us3 displays no sequence homology with the cellular kinase Akt, yet directly phosphorylates tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) on the same sites as Akt. TSC2 depletion rescued Us3-deficient virus replication, establishing that Us3 enhances replication by phosphorylating TSC2 to constitutively activate mTORC1, effectively bypassing S6K-mediated feedback inhibition. Moreover, Us3 stimulated Akt substrate phosphorylation in infected cells, including FOXO1 and GSK3. Thus, HSV-1 encodes an Akt surrogate with overlapping substrate specificity to activate mTORC1, stimulating translation and virus replication. This establishes Us3 as a unique viral kinase with promising drug development potential.",nocancer"Alternative cell death mechanisms in development and beyond. A canonical regulatory pathway involving the members of the Bcl-2 and caspase families has been established to regulate developmental apoptosis in nematodes and flies. However, mutant mice that have major deficiencies in this apoptosis pathway show only relatively minor developmental defects. Recent revelations indicate that multiple mechanisms are involved in regulating cell death during mammalian development, tissue homeostasis, and pathological cell loss. Here, we critically evaluate the evidence demonstrating the existence of alternative cell death mechanisms, including apoptosis of lower organisms in the absence of canonical apoptosis mediators, autophagic cell death, necroptosis, elimination by shedding, keratinocyte death by cornification, and cell-cell cannibalism by entosis. The physiological relevance of alternative cell death mechanisms as primary and backup mechanisms is discussed.",nocancer"Deterioration without replenishment--the misery of oocyte cohesin. Humans suffer a steep increase in aneuploidies when oocytes age, and deterioration of cohesin was suggested recently as a prominent cause. In the November 15, 2010, issue of Genes & Development, Tachibana-Konwalski and colleagues (pp. 2505-2516) answered a question central to this hypothesis: Can cohesin be reloaded onto mouse oocyte chromosomes long after birth? They found that it cannot, or at least not with an efficiency adequate to rescue cohesin deficiency. With no chance for sufficient replenishment, age-related loss of sister chromatid cohesion seems unavoidable.",nocancer"Herpes Simplex Virus is Akt-ing in translational control. All viruses depend on the cellular protein synthesis machinery for the production of viral proteins. Thus, viruses have evolved a variety of strategies to avoid innate host responses that inhibit protein synthesis. In this issue of Genes & Development, Chuluunbaatar and colleagues (pp. 2627-2639) demonstrate that Herpes Simplex Virus-1 counteracts this response through viral kinase Us3, which mimics cellular kinase Akt to phosphorylate and repress tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), resulting in the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and enhancement of mRNA translation.",nocancer"Malaysian dental graduates' competence in holistic care: what do graduates and employers think? The purpose of this study was to explore the University of Malaya (UM) dental graduates' competence in holistic care in real settings from the employers' and graduates' perspectives. A self-administered questionnaire consisting of ten domains was sent to thirty senior dental officers of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and 164 UM graduates. In this article, nineteen major competencies that best represent the graduates' competence in the provision of holistic care are discussed. Each competency was rated on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 4 (very good) and was categorized as ""poor and of major concern"" (if less than 60 percent of respondents scored good or very good), ""satisfactory and of minor concern"" (60-69 percent), or ""excellent"" (70 percent and above). One hundred and six out of 164 graduates (64.6 percent) and twenty-nine out of thirty employers (96.7 percent) responded. Overall, the employers rated the graduates lower than what the graduates rated themselves on all items. While the graduates felt they were excellent and satisfactory in sixteen out of nineteen items (84.2 percent), the employers felt they were poor in fourteen out of nineteen (73.7 percent). Both groups agreed that the graduates were excellent in communication, but poor in life-saving skills, obtaining patient's family and psychosocial histories, and recognizing signs and symptoms (not intraoral) indicating the presence of a systemic disease. In conclusion, although the graduates felt competent in the majority of the holistic care competencies, the employers had some reservations over such claims. Outcomes of the study led to recommendations to incorporate longer community-based learning hours, an improved behavioral science component, a module for special care patients, and multidepartmental collaborative teachings in the new integrated program aimed for implementation in 2011.",nocancer"Improving assessment in dental education through a paradigm of comprehensive care: a case report. The assessment of clinical competence in health disciplines is a critical issue. Universities have a responsibility to graduate students who can demonstrate fitness to practice because clinical competence relates directly to the quality of patients' care-the quality of their treatment, their health outcomes, and their experience. In respect of the last of these, this article argues that the nature of what we term ""clinical competence"" ought to recognize the patient before the medical/dental condition or clinical intervention and, in order to achieve this, dental education should adopt learning, teaching, and assessment strategies that develop integrated learning outcomes consistent with a paradigm of comprehensive care. The article describes the ways in which this paradigm has been operationalized in the learning, teaching, and assessment strategies at Griffith University in Australia. It places a particular focus upon the assessment methods used in the Bachelor of Oral Health program. In this way, the article aims to illustrate ways that the quality of the assessment of clinical competence can, and should, be improved. While this is a work in progress, this description may be useful for educators at other academic dental institutions who wish to adopt, adapt, and develop similar approaches.",nocancer"Augmented kinematic feedback from haptic virtual reality for dental skill acquisition. We have developed a haptic virtual reality system for dental skill training. In this study we examined several kinds of kinematic information about the movement provided by the system supplement knowledge of results (KR) in dental skill acquisition. The kinematic variables examined involved force utilization (F) and mirror view (M). This created three experimental conditions that received augmented kinematic feedback (F, M, FM) and one control condition that did not (KR-only). Thirty-two dental students were randomly assigned to four groups. Their task was to perform access opening on the upper first molar with the haptic virtual reality system. An acquisition session consisted of two days of ten trials of practice in which augmented kinematic feedback was provided for the appropriate experimental conditions after each trial. One week after, a retention test consisting of two trials without augmented feedback was completed. The results showed that the augmented kinematic feedback groups had larger mean performance scores than the KR-only group in Day 1 of the acquisition and retention sessions (ANOVA, p<0.05). The apparent differences among feedback groups were not significant in Day 2 of the acquisition session (ANOVA, p>0.05). The trends in acquisition and retention sessions suggest that the augmented kinematic feedback can enhance the performance earlier in the skill acquisition and retention sessions.",nocancer"Teaching dental students motivational interviewing techniques: analysis of a third-year class assignment. Motivational interviewing (MI) has been promoted in recent years as an effective method for engaging patients in positive health behaviors and increasing adherence to treatment regimens. The purpose of this study was to evaluate a brief training of MI techniques provided within the dental school curriculum. Third-year dental students received three hours of instruction on MI theory and techniques and then were assigned to use the method with a patient and report on their attempt in a paper. To determine if the brief training and paper assignment were effective methods for training students and assessing their understanding of MI methods, the papers were analyzed to assess aspects of the students' self-reported use of MI-related methods. Effective use of MI techniques was demonstrated by students who appropriately matched their intervention to the patient's stage of readiness to change, accurately recognized patient resistance, and responded to resistance. The paper assignment appeared to be an effective method to assess the students' use and understanding of MI-related techniques.",nocancer"Reflective blogs in clinical education to promote critical thinking in dental hygiene students. One challenge facing dental hygiene, as well as dental, education is to identify clinical teaching strategies promoting critical thinking and clinical reasoning. These skills are crucial elements in the practice of dental hygiene. A two-group design (intervention, n=28, and control, n=30) assessed first-year dental hygiene students using pre-and post-Health Science Reasoning Test (HSRT) scores to evaluate the effect of reflective blogging on critical thinking skills. A reflective blog rubric, based on Mezirow's levels of reflection, determined if reflective blogging increased the level of reflection for dental hygiene students. The results suggest within this nonprobability sample that reflective blogging did not produce a significant change in students' HSRT scores (p>0.05). However, analyses of reflective blog rubric scores demonstrated statistically significant improvements (p<0.05) in students' levels of reflection. Furthermore, data analysis revealed a correlation (p<0.05) between HSRT subscale scores and the element of reflection scores for the intervention group. This study addressed needs of the dental and dental hygiene education community by examining the use of blogs, an emerging technology, as a tool for reflecting on clinical experiences and, in turn, for promoting critical thinking.",nocancer"Faculty and student perceptions of the success of a hybrid-PBL dental curriculum in achieving curriculum reform benchmarks. The dental education literature identifies eleven benchmark reform agenda curriculum qualities. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which the University of British Columbia D.M.D. curriculum was perceived by students and faculty as achieving these benchmarks and to note any differences in perceptions within and between the student and faculty groups. A WebEval survey consisting of twenty-one questions was delivered online in November 2007 to faculty members and D.M.D. students. The response rate was similar (~60 percent) for both students and faculty members. Comparisons were made between faculty members and students as well as within each group. For the faculty, we looked at the influence of appointment, focus, and teaching experience. For students, we looked at the influence of the year in the program, gender, and program track. Some differences (p<0.05) were identified within the faculty and student groups; however, there were many more differences between the faculty and the students, especially in areas related to curriculum redesign, collaborations with other health professions, preparation for independent practice, and creating a trust-based clinic environment. Faculty members were more optimistic about curriculum progress than were students. Improved communication of curriculum goals and explicit efforts at creating a safe and supportive learning environment could diminish these differences over time.",nocancer"Dental professionals' knowledge and perceived need for education in bioterrorism preparedness. Dental professionals should be well prepared to provide care during bioterrorist events. In this study, we assessed the knowledge, opinions about playing various roles during a bioterrorist event, and perceived need for education of dental professionals (dentists and dental hygienists) from one region (Oregon) that had been exposed to bioterrorism and from another region (New England) not exposed. This cross-sectional study used an eighteen-item pretested, self-administered questionnaire distributed at the 2005 Oregon Dental Conference (n=156) and 2005 Yankee Dental Conference (n=297). Dental professionals' knowledge and perceived need for education on bioterrorist preparedness were quantified by multivariate linear and logistic modeling. More than 90 percent of the dental professionals were willing to provide care during bioterrorist events. Perceived knowledge was high; however, actual knowledge was low. Dental professionals who wanted to attend a continuing education course and who thought dental professionals should play more roles during a bioterrorist attack had higher actual knowledge. Willingness to provide care was not supported by adequate knowledge. No significant differences between New England and Oregon dental professionals were observed in terms of actual knowledge or perceived need for bioterrorism education. Integrating training and education into the predoctoral dental and dental hygiene curricula and developing continuing education courses would improve knowledge and better prepare dental professionals to effectively perform American Dental Association-recommended roles during any future bioterrorism events.",nocancer"Dental students research inventory: a questionnaire to assess research challenges and opportunities. The aim of this study was to develop and test a questionnaire to measure the research challenges and opportunities faced by dental students. The initial part of the study dealt with designing, developing, and pilot testing of the questionnaire (Dental Students Research Inventory, DSRI), and the later part consisted of field testing. The validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability of the DSRI were performed to provide a standardized measure and an interpretation scale. The results showed good reliability and repeatability of the questionnaire, with a greater reliability observed in postgraduate students as compared to undergraduates. In the survey of regional dental colleges in India, 25 percent of the postgraduate and 35 percent of the undergraduate students reported that there was an overall lack of opportunities in conducting research. The DSRI questionnaire can be a good measure for understanding the challenges and opportunities faced by dental students while conducting and reporting research.",nocancer"Dental education and dentists' attitudes and behavior concerning patients with autism. The number of patients diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in the United States has increased significantly. The objectives of this study were to explore general and pediatric dentists' professional attitudes and behavior towards patients with ASD; these dentists' perceptions of their dental education about these issues; and the relationships among their educational experiences, attitudes, and behaviors concerning patients with ASD. Survey data were collected from 162 general dentists in Michigan and 212 pediatric dentists across the United States. The results showed that 89 percent of pediatric dentists and 32 percent of general dentists treat patients with ASD. The respondents disagreed with statements indicating that their predoctoral dental education had prepared them well to treat patients with ASD. However, the better they felt prepared, the more likely they were to provide care for these patients. The frequency with which pediatric dentists said they use appropriate behavior management strategies when treating patients with ASD correlated with the quality of their educational experiences. In conclusion, given the growing number of patients with ASD, it is important to revisit dental education efforts targeted towards preparing future dental care providers for the treatment of patients with ASD and special needs.",nocancer"The Dental Values Scale: development and validation. The purpose of this study was to produce a valid scale for use in measuring the values of dental students and practitioners--the lack of which has impeded research on professionalism in dentistry. Following standard scale development procedures, we had focus groups of dental practitioners (N=23) develop a ninety-nine-item pool of value terms related to dentistry. Next, Canadian dentists (N=449) rated the relevance of each item through an online survey. They also rated the values in a generic values measure, Schwartz's Values Scale. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses identified twenty-five items representing five values: Altruism, Personal Satisfaction, Conscientiousness, Quality of Life, and Professional Status. These values correlate with related dimensions from Schwartz's measure; they also correspond to the values in the American Dental Education Association's statement on professionalism. We then administered the new Dental Values Scale to dental students (N=96) to determine the relationship between practitioner and student values. First-year students were higher in Conscientiousness, Altruism, and Personal Satisfaction than practitioners, but these values decreased over time to those held by the dentists. We discuss the implication of these results and the potential value of the new scale for dental education.",nocancer"Prereferral rectal artesunate for treatment of severe childhood malaria: a cost-effectiveness analysis. BACKGROUND: Severely ill patients with malaria with vomiting, prostration, and altered consciousness cannot be treated orally and need injections. In rural areas, access to health facilities that provide parenteral antimalarial treatment is poor. Safe and effective treatment of most severe malaria cases is delayed or not achieved. Rectal artesunate interrupts disease progression by rapidly reducing parasite density, but should be followed by further antimalarial treatment. We estimated the cost-effectiveness of community-based prereferral artesunate treatment of children suspected to have severe malaria in areas with poor access to formal health care. METHODS: We assessed the cost-effectiveness (in international dollars) of the intervention from the provider perspective. We studied a cohort of 1000 newborn babies until 5 years of age. The analysis assessed how the cost-effectiveness results changed with low (25%), moderate (50%), high (75%), and full (100%) referral compliance and intervention uptake. FINDINGS: At low intervention uptake and referral compliance (25%), the intervention was estimated to avert 19 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs; 95% CI 16-21) and to cost I$1173 (95% CI 1050-1297) per DALY averted. Under the full uptake and compliance scenario (100%), the intervention could avert 967 DALYs (884-1050) at a cost of I$77 (73-81) per DALY averted. INTERPRETATION: Prereferral artesunate treatment is a cost-effective, life-saving intervention, which can substantially improve the management of severe childhood malaria in rural African settings in which programmes for community health workers are in place.

BACKGROUND: A high body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) is associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular disease and certain cancers, but the precise relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality remains uncertain. METHODS: We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for an association between BMI and all-cause mortality, adjusting for age, study, physical activity, alcohol consumption, education, and marital status in pooled data from 19 prospective studies encompassing 1.46 million white adults, 19 to 84 years of age (median, 58). RESULTS: The median baseline BMI was 26.2. During a median follow-up period of 10 years (range, 5 to 28), 160,087 deaths were identified. Among healthy participants who never smoked, there was a J-shaped relationship between BMI and all-cause mortality. With a BMI of 22.5 to 24.9 as the reference category, hazard ratios among women were 1.47 (95 percent confidence interval [CI], 1.33 to 1.62) for a BMI of 15.0 to 18.4; 1.14 (95% CI, 1.07 to 1.22) for a BMI of 18.5 to 19.9; 1.00 (95% CI, 0.96 to 1.04) for a BMI of 20.0 to 22.4; 1.13 (95% CI, 1.09 to 1.17) for a BMI of 25.0 to 29.9; 1.44 (95% CI, 1.38 to 1.50) for a BMI of 30.0 to 34.9; 1.88 (95% CI, 1.77 to 2.00) for a BMI of 35.0 to 39.9; and 2.51 (95% CI, 2.30 to 2.73) for a BMI of 40.0 to 49.9. In general, the hazard ratios for the men were similar. Hazard ratios for a BMI below 20.0 were attenuated with longer-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In white adults, overweight and obesity (and possibly underweight) are associated with increased all-cause mortality. All-cause mortality is generally lowest with a BMI of 20.0 to 24.9.",nocancer"Health hazards of ""don't ask, don't tell"". While U.S. courts consider a lawsuit alleging that the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy violates the rights of gay and lesbian service members, the policy continues to jeopardize the health of those service members, the military, and the country at large.",nocancer"Atlas occipitalization in a supersonic fighter pilot involved in a midair collision: a case report. We report a case of a midair collision between two F16 fighter aircraft, in which one pilot survived and the other was ejected upon impact and his remains recovered from sea. In autopsy, no patholgy was detected, other than the expected evidence of mechanical trauma. No defects in the aircraft or faults in the parachute or ejection mechanism were found. Reconstruction of the shattered skull base and the cervical vertebrae revealed fusion of the atlanto-occipital joint (occipitalization) and a left paracondylar process. The effective diameter of the spinal canal was decreased by the abnormal articulation. Such malformations can cause a wide range of neurologic deficits. Considering the skill and alertness needed to operate a supersonic fighter aircraft, with the pressure applied by the heavy protective head gear and various G forces endured by the spinal column during flight, we postulate that the collision was related to the pilot's sudden incapacitation.",nocancer"Migrating shrapnel: a rare cause of knee synovitis. Shrapnel injuries in soft tissues often do not require surgical excision. Metals that remain embedded in the surrounding tissue are not thought to cause significant damage and the patients are generally asymptomatic. This case presentation describes a patient who sustained a penetrating shrapnel injury to his thigh, where the metal fragment was not removed. However, more than 20 years later, the patient developed knee synovitis. On X-ray the shrapnel was seen in the suprapatellar pouch. An arthroscopy was preformed and the shrapnel was removed with full healing of the patient. Conclusion: although nonsurgical treatment of shrapnel in soft tissues is the treatment of choice in many cases, late migration is possible, causing distal symptoms and may require surgical excision.",nocancer"Extraordinary military medical care of a pediatric patient with penetrating pelvic trauma: a case report. Modern military medicine is an ever advancing field, capable of remarkable feats. We present the case of a 16-year-old Iraqi female with a single gunshot wound to the pelvis with extensive rectal injury who survived despite the odds. Using ""damage control"" techniques, this patient survived despite a reported 30% mortality associated with such wounds. During the course of her stay, she was cared for by a multidisciplinary team whose integrated efforts led to survival and complete closure of 2 of 3 wounds prior to discharge. The case demonstrates the success of modern military medical measures applied to a malnourished pediatric civilian in an austere environment. In addition to being noteworthy as an extraordinary case of survival, this case raises questions about the implications of practicing short-term modern medicine on a population that will have to be reintegrated into a primitive medical establishment, possibly before definitive care is complete.",nocancer"Multisystem organ failure due to Gemella morbillorum native valve endocarditis. Gemella morbillorum is a gram positive cocci, considered normal flora of the upper respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract in humans. As a pathogen, there are reported cases of infectious endocarditis, bacteremia, sepsis, and abscesses, primarily associated with dental instrumentation, prosthetic heart valves, colon cancer, and endovascular access. We report a case of an 87-year-old Caucasian male with a history of a ruptured chordae of the anterior mitral leaflet, severe mitral regurgitation (MR), and atrial fibrillation who developed multisystem organ failure due to Gemella morbillorum native valve endocarditis without any precipitating factor. He was diagnosed per Duke criteria, treated with intravenous fluids, packed red blood cell transfusion, and broad spectrum antibiotics, with improvement in his clinical course. Our patient survived despite his generalized poor health, where he was eventually discharged to a skilled nursing facility.",nocancer"The association between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and microvascular complications in well-controlled diabetic patients. BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) may promote hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. OBJECTIVE: We studied the link between sleep apnea and microvascular diabetic complications in veterans with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM-2). DESIGN: A retrospective electronic chart of all veterans referred for sleep studies over a 1-year period was reviewed. Ninety-eight patients with a glycosylated hemoglobin < 6.5% were included in the study. The degree of glycemia (HbA1c) and presence of macro- and microvascular complications were compared with OSAS variables. METHOD: Statistical analysis examined bivariate associations between OSAS variables and metabolic syndrome parameters. RESULTS: The apnea hypopnea index was significantly related to diabetic microvascular complications, particularly retinopathy. Oxygen desaturation was significantly and inversely related to microalbuminuria, microvascular complications, retinopathy, and HbA1c. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep apnea is associated with microvascular complications even in well-controlled DM-2 veterans. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Screening for OSAS should be considered in patients with DM-2.",nocancer"Pharmacy experience with facsimile prescriptions. The purpose of this mixed qualitative/quantitative study was to review the impact of a policy to accept facsimile (fax) prescriptions as standard operating procedure. Between February and April 2009 the pharmacy processed 4,792 new prescriptions of which 363 (7.6%) were received through fax. Of the fax prescriptions, 19 (5.2%) concerned clarification of information, which took approximately 30 minutes to resolve. The fax prescription process allowed the pharmacy to adjust the distribution of its workload, provided quicker service for new prescriptions, and allowed more time for medication consultation that resulted in a high level of customer satisfaction. It appeared the policy allowing fax prescriptions was a ""win-win"" situation for both the pharmacy and its customers. Military pharmacies should consider running trials of accepting fax prescriptions to see whether it improves their prescription filling process.",nocancer"Comparison of in-office dental unit waterline test kits. The authors conducted a study to determine the validity of two commercially available in-office dental unit waterline test kits compared to the gold standard, R2A agar. Samples were collected from the air/water syringes of dental units and cultured on HPC Samplers, Petrifilm AC Plates, and R2A agar plates. HPC Samplers and R2A agar plates were incubated for 7 days and counted manually using magnification. Petrifilm AC Plates were counted after incubation time of 5 and 7 days using an electronic-plate reader. Validity measurements were calculated using a cutoff value < or = 500 colony-forming units per milliliter. The accuracy for the HPC Sampler compared to R2A agar was 71%. The accuracy for the Petrifilm AC Plates at 5 and 7 days was 79% and 87% compared to R2A agar. The Petrifilm AC Plate (7-day incubation) demonstrated higher sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and accuracy than the HPC Sampler kit.",nocancer"An evaluation of U.S. Navy Dental Corps classification guidelines. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this research were to evaluate the effectiveness of two different sets of dental classification guidelines to differentiate dental emergency (DE) rates between deployable and nondeployable personnel. METHODS: A retrospective study of the dental records of two cohorts of Marine Corps recruits examined and treated using different classification guidelines was completed. RESULTS: Both classification systems showed significant differences between DE rates of nondeployable and deployable personnel. No statistical difference was observed when comparing the adjusted HRs of the two cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that both guidelines are able to distinguish between deployable and nondeployable personnel and give reasonable assurance that class 1 and 2 patients will not experience a DE for a 6-month period. Incorporating factors such as caries risk, number of missing and filled teeth, and number of third molars may improve the ability of the dental classification systems in predicting DE.",nocancer"Births to adolescents in the U.S. military healthcare system. PURPOSE: To describe the rate and sociodemographic profile of live births to adolescents having U.S. Department of Defense healthcare coverage because of parental military service. METHODS: All live births identified from the M2 database during 2003-2006 to 10- to 23-year olds in this population were stratified and compared. RESULTS: Birth rates rose in the 18- to 19- and 20- to 23-year-old groups over the 4 years studied (p < 0.05). Daughters of active duty personnel had higher live birth rates than daughters of retirees (7.1 vs. 6.1 age 15-17; p < 0.05). Birth rates differed among dependents of junior enlistees, senior enlistees, and officers (7.1, 9.4, 3.8, respectively; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent dependents in this system have an increasing, though low, live birth rate. Those with active duty sponsors have a significantly higher rate than their age-matched peers with retired sponsors. Further study is warranted to identify factors unique to this population that may influence birth patterns.",nocancer"Practice patterns of primary care providers and urologists for use of medical expulsion therapy. PURPOSE: Alpha-blockers and calcium channel blockers have shown promise for medical expulsion therapy (MET) of distal ureteral calculi < 1 cm in size. Although MET has been discussed in urology for some time, little has been written about MET in the emergency medicine and primary care literature. We sought to evaluate current practice patterns of MET among urologists, emergency medicine physicians, other primary care providers, and frontline military care providers. METHODS: Web-based, self-developed survey to assess the current practice patterns of providers for the initial management of uncomplicated ureteral calculi, and specifically, their frequency of using MET. Cross-tabulation strategies utilizing compiled survey results were used to assess survey outcomes and determine prevalence values for understanding, familiarity, and therapeutic interventions for nephrolithiasis. RESULTS: Of 293 medical professionals, 114 (39%) were urologists, 55 (48%) of which were fellowship trained in endourology. Fifty-six (19%) were emergency medicine physicians, 22 (8%) were family practitioners, and 19 (7%) were internists and other primary care physicians. Other physician subspecialists and medical paraprofessionals comprised the remaining 34%. Overall 27% of respondents were unfamiliar with MET for expulsion of uncomplicated ureteral stones, including 13% of staff physicians, 21% of emergency medicine doctors, 56% of family practitioners, 40% of internists, and 43% of other primary care providers. The overall prevalence of use of MET was 45%. All urologists were familiar with MET, but 31% rarely, never, or only sometimes used this therapy. Specifically, urologists, emergency physicians, family practitioners, internists, and other providers, usually or always used MET 69%, 55%, 16%, 16%, and 27%, of the time, respectively. In academic institutions, 71.6% use MET usually or almost always compared to 36% in military healthcare settings and 47% in other practice settings. Tamsulosin is the most widely used medication for MET, accounting for 57% of MET use. Factors identified that inhibit more widespread use of MET include, physician unfamiliarity with MET (72%), the belief that MET is not effective (10%), patient unwillingness to undergo MET (5%), and medications not covered by insurance plans (4%). CONCLUSION: While MET has been established as a reasonable adjunct for management of uncomplicated ureteral stones, it may be underutilized due to physician unfamiliarity with this type of treatment and perceived ineffectiveness. This therapy may be of particular benefit to forward deployed forces. Education programs and practice-specific guidelines to target this audience may help to improve the dispersion of MET into the medical community.",nocancer"Analgesic benefit of niacin for shrapnel wound pain in war veteran. We report a case of an 86-year-old male with a history of dyslipidemia, which had been treated with a medication regimen that included niacin.

With reinitation of niacin, his pain again abated.",nocancer"Case study: a novel biomechanical approach for evaluating extended body armor systems. To combat the devastating effects of improvised explosive devices (IEDs), body armor that provides extended coverage has been developed. However, this extended coverage increases the armor's weight and may restrict movement. Throughout this case study, a novel technique to assess several armor systems was investigated. Four soldiers performed shoulder and trunk movements while wearing each of the six different armor inserts. Electromyography (EMG) was used to quantify muscular activity and inertial motion sensors were used to determine joint range of motion (ROM). Outcome measures included maximum ROM, integrated EMG, and the soldiers' subjective rankings. For the shoulder tasks, objective ROM and EMG measures were related to each other as well as to subjective rankings and armor material properties. Conversely, little agreement was found between measures for the trunk tasks. Results of this preliminary investigation indicate that combining shoulder ROM and EMG measures has the potential to provide an objective assessment of body armor systems.",nocancer"Hearing and sound source identification with protective headwear. This study investigated the effect on hearing, sound attenuation, and sound source identification of a prototype neck and two prototype mandible guards attached to a combat helmet. Ten male subjects participated. Free-field hearing thresholds were measured from 250 Hz to 8,000 Hz with the head bare and fitted with the helmet alone and with the guards. Sound source identification was assessed using a horizontal array of eight loudspeakers surrounding the subject. The stimulus was a 75-dB SPL, 300-ms noise burst. Neither the helmet worn alone or with the guards affected hearing or provided significant sound attenuation. The helmet combinations resulted in a significant decrease in sound source identification, of 11.6%. This was due to diminished accuracy for loudspeakers close to the interaural axis of the head. The neck guard induced a frontal bias for these positions. This error pattern is not likely to interfere with localization during combat.",nocancer"Recognition of military-specific physical activities with body-fixed sensors. The purpose of this study was to develop and validate an algorithm for recognizing military-specific, physically demanding activities using body-fixed sensors. To develop the algorithm, the first group of study participants (n = 15) wore body-fixed sensors capable of measuring acceleration, step frequency, and heart rate while completing six military-specific activities: walking, marching with backpack, lifting and lowering loads, lifting and carrying loads, digging, and running. The accuracy of the algorithm was tested in these isolated activities in a laboratory setting (n = 18) and in the context of daily military training routine (n = 24). The overall recognition rates during isolated activities and during daily military routine activities were 87.5% and 85.5%, respectively. We conclude that the algorithm adequately recognized six military-specific physical activities based on sensor data alone both in a laboratory setting and in the military training environment. By recognizing type of physical activities this objective method provides additional information on military-job descriptions.",nocancer"Prevalence of anterior knee pain and pes planus in Israel defense force recruits. This study examined the prevalence of anterior knee pain (AKP) and pes planus (PP) in Israeli defense force recruits and assessed the relationship between these conditions. We examined the medical records of 97,279 recruits--18,338 females and 78,941 males. The prevalence of AKP was 4.15%. It was lower in females (2.39%) than in males (4.56%). The prevalence of flexible and rigid PP were 15.30% and 0.83%, respectively. The prevalence of both conditions was lower in females (11.31% and 0.34%) than in males (16.23% and 0.94%). AKP was more prevalent in individuals with flexible PP (4.50%) than with normal feet (4.06%) and more prevalent in individuals with rigid PP (6.93%) than in individuals with flexible PP. Despite current opinion, AKP is more common in males than in females. The role of orthotics in individuals with AKP and PP should be more thoroughly investigated.",nocancer"Awareness and compliance with recommended running shoe guidelines among U.S. Army soldiers. The purpose of this study was to determine awareness and compliance with recommended running shoe selection, sizing, and replacement guidelines among U.S. Army soldiers. Soldiers (n = 524) attending training at Fort Sam Houston, Texas completed self-report questionnaires and a foot assessment, which included measurement of foot size and arch height index. Researchers examined each soldier's running shoes for type, wear pattern, and general condition. Thirty-five percent of the soldiers wore shoes that were inappropriately sized; 56.5% wore shoes that were inappropriate for their foot type. Thirty-five percent of the soldiers had excessively worn shoes and 63% did not know recommended shoe replacement guidelines. Further efforts may be necessary to ensure that soldiers are aware of and compliant with recommended running shoe selection, sizing, and replacement guidelines. Future research is needed to determine whether adherence to these guidelines has a favorable effect on reducing risk of overuse injury.",nocancer"Efficacy of a brief cognitive behavioral therapy program to reduce excessive drinking behavior among new recruits entering the Irish Navy: a pilot evaluation. This pilot study evaluated the efficacy of a brief cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention program designed to reduce excessive pre-enlistment drinking behaviors in a sample of Irish Navy recruits undergoing a 16-week basic training course. Participants were randomly allocated to either a treatment (TG) or control group (CG) (N = 13 each). The program was conducted over four consecutive 1.5-hour weekly sessions. Data were collected at pre and post intervention as well as at a 2-month follow-up. In comparison to those in the control group, participants who received the intervention reported increased scores (p < 0.05) in readiness to change drinking at time 2 and reduced scores in binge drinking (p < 0.05) at time 3. There were also marginal changes in self-efficacy and risky drinking behavior. This work adds to the evidence of the emerging efficacy of a workplace CBT intervention for unhealthy drinking.",nocancer"Veteran tobacco use, low-density lipoprotein, and glycated hemoglobin levels. The deidentified electronic medical records of 1,452 veterans with a history of smoking and assigned to an outpatient Department of Veteran Affairs Medical Center were examined. Descriptive statistics and two repeated measures ANCOVA were performed to determine the demographic characteristics of the sample and the relationships between the independent variable of tobacco use group on the dependent variables of LDL cholesterol and HbA1c levels, during the years 2003 through 2007. There was no statistically significant relationship between tobacco use and LDL levels when controlling for weight. There was a statistically significant difference in the tobacco use groups and HbA1c levels. Current smokers had higher HbA1c levels than did former smokers throughout the observational period, but the difference was statistically significant only for the years 2003 and 2007. Thus health care providers are challenged to monitor for cardiovascular risk factors, assist patients with smoking cessation, and prevent tobacco use.",nocancer"Coordinating medical civil military operations in Multinational Division-North. Medical civil military operations (MCMO) are part of military civil capacity-building efforts within the full spectrum of military operations, from war to military operations other than war. In 2008-2009 during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Division Surgeon's Section (DSS) of the 25th Infantry Division (25ID) and Multinational Division-North developed an innovative MCMO program in northern Iraq. The program centered on understanding and mapping key relationships, empowering brigade-level programs, and leveraging technology to identify and share best practices. The DSS mapped the critical relationships within and between the three entities affecting MCMO: the government of Iraq (GOI), Department of State (DOS), and the Department of Defense (DOD). A division MCMO working group was then created along with processes to facilitate MCMO project execution and program management. The structure and organization of the 25ID MCMO program lend themselves to other operational environments requiring synchronization of medical capacity-building efforts.",nocancer"Providing a dairy-free diet for children. Cow's milk protein allergy is a common food allergy in infants and children, and along with lactose intolerance it requires a dairy-free diet at a time when adequate nutrition is critical.

Professionals need to base advice to parents on current evidence to improve client confidence and outcomes.",nocancer"Working in partnership with the voluntary sector: early explorer clinics. The first three years of life have been identified as key to promoting children's later wellbeing, and partnership working across the statutory and voluntary sectors has been proposed as one of the best ways to meet the needs of families. Child health clinics are attended by parents seeking reassurance or help and advice from a health professional regarding child health and development. They have been used in Oxford to develop Early Explorer clinics, in which the statutory health visiting service and voluntary sector Peers Early Education Programme work together with the aim of improving outcomes for children and families. These Early Explorer clinics provide the opportunity to engage parents in supporting their child's development through interaction and non-directed exploratory play. They also offer opportunities to identify vulnerable families, who are provided with additional support. This paper examines a model of partnership working between statutory and voluntary sectors aimed at maximising opportunities to promote the health and wellbeing of infants and their families.",nocancer"Health visitors: finding their place in children's centres. Children's centres aim to improve outcomes for children through the development of integrated services. Health visitors are expected to lead the delivery of child health promotion programmes in geographical areas that include children's centres. During 2007, a group of eight health visitors linked to Phase 2 children's centres in Bristol formed a learning set facilitated by a public health specialist to explore how their role as both caseworkers and public health practitioners could become part of an integrated children's centre team. They developed two linked models intended to help health visitors develop both aspects of their role in practice. First, a proposed management structure for a children's centre which included health visitors at both the strategic and practice delivery levels of the organisation. Second, a conceptualisation of how the proposed management structure would support and develop an integrated team. The paper then discusses an early attempt by one children's centre in Bristol to implement the two models through the development of an integrated outreach team.",nocancer"Explaining the principles of health visiting in Brazil. Brazil is a rapidly developing country. Modern health services operate in a situation of extreme social change, which resembles some of the conditions that gave rise to health visiting in 19th century Britain. A visit there revealed much interest in the health visiting principles of the search for health needs, the stimulation of an awareness of health needs, the influence on policies affecting health and the facilitation of health-enhancing activities. Explaining these principles to an audience on the other side of the world highlighted three underlying themes. The principles of health visiting are about health promotion, not assistance; they provide an integrated framework, not a list of competences or skills; and they are all underpinned by a particular value and view of health. The explana-tion was met with great interest. We need to be both more aware and better able to explain these underlying themes in this country as well.",nocancer"Exploring the concept of empathy in nursing: can it lead to abuse of patient trust?

Work as a dentist is stressful and demanding. In the Public Dental Health Service (PDHS) the heads of clinics' have a great influence on the work environment. In turn the heads have to adapt to the overarching policies on management in each County, which create the environment for the clinics. The aims of this paper were to describe the management structure of the PDHS as described by their Chief Dental Officers (CDOs), and to test hypotheses that the management systems had ""a logical administrative structure"". A postal questionnaire was mailed to all 21 CDOs,who all responded. Context analysis and bivariate correlations were used. The PDHS employed on average 60% of all dentists in a county. The numbers of clinics for general dentistry in Sweden was 698, and for specialist care 144. The heads of clinics were dentists in 92%. Four hypotheses were tested. 1. separate political board did not lead to closer governance of the PDHS. 2. There was more emphasis on measurable than on qualitative objectives and followup. 3. There was only partial correlation between a larger county and a more formalized management. 4. There was no correlation between size of county and beliefs on advantages of scale. There was a widespread belief in advantages with larger clinics both from administrative, and rather surprisingly, from clinical aspects. Two of the four hypotheses could not be corroborated which indicates that the management structures were more formed by county specific principles. The four hypotheses on administrative behaviour were only partially corroborated. The implications for delivery of care to sparsely populated areas need to be monitored in view of the beliefs in larger clinics. The limits for decisions by management and for professional discretion must be monitored closely considering their effects on work environment and on the quality of care the professionals are able to deliver.",nocancer"Duration of orthodontic treatment in conjunction with orthognathic surgery. Patients considering undergoing combined orthodontic-orthognathic treatment for correction of malocclusion require appropriate information, particularly with respect to duration of treatment. The primary aim of this study was to determine the duration of orthodontic treatment carried out in conjunction with orthognathic surgery and to analyze the influence of selected explanatory variables. A further aim was to compare the duration of orthodontic treatment in patients treated by orthodontists at Linkoping University hospital orthodontic clinic and six regional orthodontic clinics. This is a retrospective study, based on data from the orthodontic records of patients who had undergone orthognathic surgery at the University Hospital Maxillofacial Unit in Linkoping, Sweden, from 2000 to 2005. The subjects comprised 207 out of 233 patients (107 women and 100 men), aged 15.8-56.9 years, median 24.2 years at the time of surgery: 26 patients were excluded, either diagnosed with a syndrome, or because it was impossible to follow up the entire treatment. 59 subjects had undergone orthodontic treatment at the University hospital orthodontic clinic and 148 at the 6 regional orthodontic clinics. The variables recorded were gender, malocclusion, the number of appointments (scheduled and emergency) and treatment setting. The median value for pre-operative orthodontic treatment time was 19.2 months (range 2.4-68.4); for postoperative orthodontic treatment 4.6 months (range 0-18.8) and for total orthodontic treatment 27.8 months (range 5.9-79.1). For the University hospital orthodontic clinic, pre-operative (16.7 months) and total orthodontic treatment times (25 months) were significantly shorter than for the regional clinics; the duration of postoperative treatment was significantly longer (4.1 months). No other explanatory variables had a significant influence on the duration of orthodontic treatment. Compared with the regional orthodontic clinics, there were significantly fewer scheduled appointments at the University hospital orthodontic clinic, but no significant difference in emergency attendance.",nocancer"Temporomandibular disorder pain in adult Saudi Arabians referred for specialised dental treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) pain in Saudi Arabians,aged 20-40, who were referred to the Specialist Dental Centre in Makkah. The material included 325 patients (135 males,190 females) who answered a history questionnaire. Patients reportingTMD pain in the last month were offered a clinical examination. History questionnaires and clinical examinations were done according to the Arabic version of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD). Fifty-eight patients (18%) reported TMD pain; 46 were clinically examined. Mean age of clinically examined TMD pain patients was 30 +/- 7 years with a male-female ratio of 1:6 (P < 0.001). All TMD pain patients had a diagnosis of myofascial pain, and 65% had diagnoses of arthralgia or osteoarthritis. Headaches or migraines in the last 6 months and headaches in the last month were reported in high frequencies in the TMD pain group, 93% and 71% respectively, with differences (P < 0.001) between the TMD pain and non-TMD pain groups. Graded Chronic Pain Scale assessments classified 45% of the TMD pain patients in grade 1, 53% in grade II, 2% in grade III, and 0% in grade IV. Severe depression scores were found in 38% of the TMD pain patients and severe somatisation scores in 60% with differences (P < 0.001) between the TMD pain and non-TMD pain groups. In conclusion, the study found a frequency of TMD pain in this Saudi Arabian cohort of 18%. The TMD pain group presented high scores of depression and somatisation but low disability grades on the Graded Chronic Pain Scale.",nocancer"Eating disorders and signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders: a matched case-control study. The aim of the study was to examine signs and symptoms related to temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in patients with eating disorders (ED) and to compare the prevalence with that in sex- and age-matched controls. During a 12-month period, all patients (n = 65) who accepted and initiated psychiatric/medical outpatient treatment in an Eating Disorder Clinic/Erikbergsgarden, Orebro, Sweden were invited to participate in the study. Of the ED patients, 54 (83%) accepted participation. ED patients and controls underwent a comprehensive TMD questionnaire and clinical examination. Reported symptoms such as headache, facial pain,jaw tiredness, tongue thrusting, and lump feeling in the throat as well as dizziness, concentration difficulties and sleep disturbances were all significantly more prevalent among ED patients compared to controls. There was also a significantly higher prevalence of clinical TMD signs in the ED patients. Analyses within the ED group showed that those who reported self-induced vomiting reported significantly more heavy feeling in the head, nausea and snoring. Those with binge eating reported significantly more heavy feeling in the head, facial pain, dizzy feeling and concentration difficulties. No significant differences regarding subjective symptoms and clinical signs of TMD were found within the ED group with respect to duration of ED. In conclusion, orofacial pain and TMD related signs and symptoms are significantly more common in ED patients than in matched control subjects. Special emphasis should be made to those who reports vomiting and/or binge eating behaviors.",nocancer"Scanning electron microscopic and X-ray micro analysis on tooth enamel exposed to alkaline agents. The background of this study comprises two clinical cases, where patients exposed to aerosols of an alkaline and surface active cleaning agent developed loss of enamel substance on their teeth, further resulting in loss of teeth and partially destroyed soft tissues. The alkaline cleaning agent consisted of potassium hydroxide and various surfactants. The purpose of this study was to investigate possible changes in morphology and composition in human teeth enamel exposed to alkaline solutions, by means of X-ray micro analysis (XRMA), FTIR-spectroscopic analyses and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Extracted premolars, exposed to potassium hydroxide solutions and alkaline cleaning solution,were analyzed by means of XRMA and SEM. Enamel powder, exposed to cleaning solution, was analyzed by means of FTIR. The SEM analysis revealed an increased porosity of the enamel surface and partially loss of enamel substance after exposure to alkaline solutions. The XRMA analyses revealed a decrease in carbon concentration while phosphorous and calcium showed no marked changes. The FTIR analyses showed no significant changes in peak heights or peak positions for phosphate, carbonate or hydroxide. It was concluded that human teeth enamel exposed to alkaline solutions showed loss of organic substance, marked pores in enamel surface and loss of substance in the enamel surface.",nocancer"Psychosocial and dental factors in the maintenance of severe dental fear. The aim was to study the relationship between psychosocial factors and dental status in adult subjects with severe dental fear (DF). A consecutive sample of 148 adults (mean age 36.1 yrs, range 21-69 yrs) referred for dental fear treatment was investigated using an intake questionnaire on dental attendance and history, psychometric questionnaires on dental fear, general anxiety and depression and a radiographic examination. The subjects had a mean DFMT (Decayed, Filled, Missed Teeth) score of 18.6 (SD = 5.6). A deterioration in dental status defined as the presence of root remnants was present in 57% of the subjects and was related to the negative consequences of dental fear, general anxiety and depression. Most subjects (84%) reported clinical levels of general anxiety and 46% reported clinical levels of depression. In conclusion, subjects with severe DF often suffer from psychosocial consequences and distress.This is even more marked if their dental status has deteriorated.The findings support a biopsychosocial vicious circle understanding of the maintenance of DF.",nocancer"Nanotechnology and nanomaterials: toxicology, risk assessment, and regulations. Nanomaterials have very unique chemical and physical properties that suggest potential health hazards, but limited health and safety information exists for engineered nanomaterials. This review identifies a need for expanding efforts for addressing health and safety concerns in nanotechnology development and in nanotoxicology of engineered nanomaterials. The efforts include research to generate data for safety evaluation, toxicologic evaluation of potential human health effects, risk assessment to support risk-management decision-making, and regulations development to protect human health and the environment. The federal government's current understanding is that existing statutory authorities are adequate to address oversight of nanotechnology and its applications. On the other hand, the present review identifies weaknesses in the current research efforts and inadequacies in existing regulations. A collaborative effort involving multidisciplinary groups is a key element to address the related needs and issues. While federal agencies with regulatory responsibilities are looked upon to develop and implement sound policies and regulations to protect public health and the environment, state agencies may be required to initiate policies which rapidly incorporate new innovations and address public concerns. To address current and futures need related to nanotechnology, the responsible state agencies need to fill the information gaps and address the health and environmental issues. In California, activities have been initiated, but legislative authority and resources are required to provide risk assessment and health protection in an efficient and timely manner.",nocancer"Biomedical activities of endohedral metallofullerene optimized for nanopharmaceutics. Endohedral metallofullerenes, a novel form of carbon-related nanomaterials, currently attract wide attention for their potential applications in biomedical fields such as therapeutic medicine. Most endohedral metallofullerenes are synthesized using C60 or higher molecular weight fullerenes because of the limited interior volume of fullerene. It is known that the encapsulated metal atom has strong electronic interactions with the carbon cage in metallofullerenes. Gd@C82 is one of the most important molecules in the metallofullerene family, known as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) contrast agent candidate for diagnostic imaging. Gadolinium endohedral metallofullerenol (e.g., Gd@C82(OH)22) is a functionalized fullerene with gadolinium trapped inside carbon cage. Our group previously demonstrated that the distinctive chemical and physical properties of Gd@C82(OH)22 are dependent on the number and position of the hydroxyl groups on the fullerene cage. The present article summarizes our latest findings of biomedical effects of Gd@C82(OH)22 and gives rise to a connected flow of the existing knowledge and information from experts in the field. It briefly narrates the synthesis and physico-chemical properties of Gd@C82(OH)22. The polyhydroxylated nanoparticles exhibit the enhanced water solubility and high purity, and were tested as a MRI contrast agent. Gd@C82(OH)22 treatment inhibited tumor growth in tumor-bearing nude mice. Although the precise mechanisms of this action are not well defined, our in vitro data suggest involvements of improved immunity and antioxidation by Gd@C82(OH)22 and its size-based selective targeting to tumor site. The review critically analyzed the relevant data instead of fact-listing, and explained the potential for developing Gd@C82(OH)22 into a diagnostic or therapeutic agent.",nocancer"Bioeffects of CdTe quantum dots on human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Quantum dots (QDs) hold great potential for applications in nanomedicine, however, their health effects are largely unknown. In the present study, the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of CdTe QDs were examined in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The QDs exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell growth. It was shown that after a 12 h treatment QDs at 1, 10, and 50 microg x ml(-1) induced formation of yH2AX foci, indicative of DNA damage, in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, QD treatment clearly induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pre-treatment with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC), a ROS scavenger, could inhibit the induction of ROS by QDs, as well as the formation of yH2AX foci. Taken together, our data indicate that CdTe QDs have cytotoxic and genotoxic effects on HUVECs, and that ROS generation may be involved in QD induced DNA damage.",nocancer"Oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by iron oxide nanoparticles in cultured human umbilical endothelial cells. Recent epidemiologic researches indicate that exposure to ultrafine particles (nanoparticles) is an independent risk factor for several cardiovascular diseases. The induction of endothelial injuries is hypothesized to be an attractive mechanism involved in these cardiovascular diseases. To investigate this hypothesis, the widely used iron nanomaterials, ferric oxide (Fe2O3) and ferriferrous oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles were incubated with human umbilical endothelial cells (ECV304 cells) at different concentrations of 2, 20, 100 microg/mL. The cell viability, the rate of apoptosis, the apoptotic nuclear morphology and the mitochondria membrane potential were measured to estimate the cell necrosis and apoptosis caused by the nanoparticle exposure. The stimulation of superoxide anion (O2*-) and nitric oxide (NO) were examined to evaluate the stress responses of endothelial cells. Our results indicated that both the Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 nanoparticles could generate oxidative stress as well as the significant increase of nitric oxide in ECV304 cells. The loss of mitochondria membrane potential and the apoptotic chromatin condensation in the nucleus were observed as the early signs of apoptosis. It is inferred the stress response might be an important mechanism involving in endothelial cells apoptosis and death, and these injuries in endothelial cells might play a key role in downstream cardiovascular diseases such as atheroscelerosis, hypertension and myocardial infarction (MI).",nocancer"Nano titanium dioxide induces the generation of ROS and potential damage in HaCaT cells under UVA irradiation. Nano titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) is frequently used in cosmetics, especially in sunscreen. Nano-TiO2 has been reported to be an efficient photocatalyst, which is able to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) under UVA irradiation. However, the effects and mechanisms of skin toxicity caused by nano-TiO2 remain unclear. In this study, we explored the cytotoxicity and oxidative stress induced by nano-TiO2 under UVA irradiation with different crystal forms (anatase, rutile and anatase/rutile) and sizes (4 nm, 10 nm, 21 nm, 25 nm, 60 nm) in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. Intracellular distribution of nano-TiO2, cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), super oxide dismutase (SOD) activity and Malondialdehyde (MDA) content were measured. The results showed that nano-TiO2 (10-200 microg/ml) significantly reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent manner in HaCaT cells. The cell viability was 76.9%, 60.2%, and 44.1% following nano-TiO2 (4 nm), nano-TiO2 (10 nm) and P25 treatment at the concentration of 200 microg/ml, respectively (P < 0.01). Nano-TiO2 induced ROS resulted in oxidative stress in these cells by reducing SOD and increasing MDA levels. The MMP of the cells was decreased significantly (P < 0.01) while the apoptosis rate was increased. Anatase and amorphous forms of nano-TiO2 showed higher cytotoxicity than the rutile form. The results indicated that nano-TiO2 could induce the generation of ROS and damage HaCaT cells under UVA irradiation.",nocancer"Pharmacokinetics and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling of nanoparticles. The worldwide commerce involving nanoparticles will soon reach $1 trillion and already we have more than 600 commercial products containing nanoparticles. Because nanoparticles are invisible and little is known about their toxicities, there has been concern about health effects in humans. As toxicology is a continuum of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, this is a review of recent advances on pharmacokinetics and physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling involving nanoparticles. We provide a synopsis of the state-of-the-science on the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of nanoparticles in mammals, as well as some of the unique applications of pharmacokinetics to nanotechnology. Earlier, the main emphasis of pharmacokinetics of nanoparticles centered around the ""control release"" of drugs. Thus, drugs encapsulated by lipidic nanoparticles or bound to nano-particles form a controlled-release mechanism. The end results included, among others, enhancement of therapeutic duration and reversion of multidrug resistance. As the science advances in this area, the resulting achievements included: (1) utilizing nanoparticles as delivery vehicle for drugs, drug combinations, or genetic materials; (2) capitalizing on physico-chemical properties and tissue affinity of nanoparticles for medical imaging; (3) potentiating drug effects on immunotoxin and anticancer drugs; and (4) creating ""stealth"" capability from body's defense system. More recently, the application of biologically-based computer modeling to nanoparticles made it possible not only for inter-species, inter-routes, and inter-dose extrapolations but also for the integration of the modern tumor biology and computational technology for the possible improvement of cancer chemotherapy. Although pharmacokinetics and PBPK modeling of nanoparticles are still in their infancy, impressive innovations have already been demonstrated in their applications to medical sciences. Nanotoxicology is one of the most promising and fertile areas of science given the importance of nanoparticles to the economy of the 21st century, their possible environmental fates, as well as the potential health concerns of these particles.",nocancer"Advances in biodistribution study and tracing methodology of carbon nanotubes. Recent advances in applications of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) require thorough investigation of their in vivo behavior and fate. Biodistribution, as fundamental information for pharmacology and toxicology, should be intensively and systematically studied to accelerate the related researches. In this review, we summarized currently applied methodology in the study of CNTs biodistribution and the achieved biodistribution data. However, the currently used methods, including isotopic labeling, Raman spectroscopy and TEM investigation, can hardly reach a perfect balance of convenience and reliability. We compared the advantage and disadvantage of each method to show diversified choices for different purposes. Based on these techniques, available data suggest that CNTs have a general trend of high reticuloendothelial system (RES) uptake. But their distribution can be dramatically regulated by functionalization of the CNT surface with various molecules. For future biodistribution studies, developing convenient and reliable methods is highly required, and key parameters determining the behavior and fate of CNTs in vivo should be further explored and elicited.",nocancer"Development and characterization of triazine based dendrimers for delivery of antitumor agent. In the present study we developed the novel kind of triazine dendrimers by utilizing differential reactivity of the cyanuric chloride (triazine trichloride) which overcome the limitations associated with the others classes of dendrimers like toxicity, low yield, high synthesis cost etc. Triazine dendrimers were synthesized by divergent method using triazine trichloride as core and diethanolamine as branching unit to avoid the use of protecting group and functional group interconversion up to third generation. These hydroxyl terminated dendrimers were characterized by FTIR, 1HNMR, 13CNMR, ES mass spectroscopy, and by elemental analysis. The yield of pure G3 dendrimers was 63%. This novel dendrimers increases the aqueous solubility of hydrophobic drug Paclitaxel up to 0.562 mg/ml as well as showed control release behavior. Hemolytic and toxicology studies of this dendrimer in mice showed no adverse toxicity to the kidneys and the liver up to 200 mg/kg dose (i.p). Triazine being a hydrophobic compound, the core of this dendrimer is hydrophobic and supposed to easily incorporate the hydrophobic guest while presence of hydroxyl group on periphery increases its water solubility and reduces its toxicity; and thus it is useful in various fields like gene delivery, MRI contrasting agents, vaccines or as solubilization tool.",nocancer"Cellular uptake of protein-bound magnetic nanoparticles in pulsed magnetic field. A method for fast delivery of proteins conjugated to superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) into mammalian cells by applying a strong magnetic field in pulses was proposed. Firstly, SPION were prepared from an alkaline solution of divalent and trivalent iron ions and covalently bound with protein through the activation of N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC). After fluorescently labelling, the protein-nanoparticle conjugate was mixed with mammalian cell line and exposed to a pulsed magnetic field for short durations of few milliseconds. Results suggested that superparamagnetic nanoparticles were able to carry proteins into living cells immediately. Cellular internalization of the fluorescently labelled protein-nanoparticle conjugate was proved by the observation of cell fluorescence in a fluorescent microscopy, as well as cell analysis by a flow cytometer. We found that the cellular uptake was accomplished dominantly by the process of bombardment of magnetic nanoparticles.",nocancer"A novel drug and gene co-delivery system based on Poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-Poly(ethylene glycol)-Poly(epsilon-caprolactone) grafted polyethyleneimine micelle. In this paper, we prepared a novel cationic self-assembled micelle from poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-poly(ethyl glycol)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) grafted polyethyleneimine (PCEC-g-PEI). The PCEC-g-PEI micelles, formed by self-assembly method, had mean particle size of ca. 82 nm and zeta potential of +22.5 mV at 37 degrees C, and could efficiently transfer pGFP into HEK293 cells in vitro. Meanwhile, as a model hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drug, honokiol was loaded into PCEC-g-PEI micelles by direct dissolution method assisted by ultrasonication. The honokiol loaded cationic PCEC-g-PEI micelles could effectively adsorb DNA onto its surface, while it could release honokiol in an extended period in vitro. This study demonstrated a novel DNA and hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drug co-delivery system.",nocancer"Nanomedicine-nanoscale drugs and delivery systems. Significant progress has been made in nanoscale drugs and delivery systems employing diverse chemical formulations to facilitate the rate of drug delivery and release from the human body. The biocompatible nanomaterials have been used in biological markers, contrast agents for biological imaging, healthcare products, pharmaceuticals, drug-delivery systems as well as in detection, diagnosis and treatment of various types of diseases. Nanomedicines offer delivery of potential drugs to human organs which were previously beyond reach of microscale drugs due to specific biological barriers. The nanoscale systems work as nanocarriers for the delivery of drugs. The nanocarriers are made of biocompatible and biodegradable materials such as synthetic proteins, peptides, lipids, polysaccharides, biodegradable polymers and fibers. This review article reports the recent developments in the field of nanomedicine covering biodegradable polymers, nanoparticles, cyclodextrin, dendrimeres, liposomes and lipid-based nanocarriers, nanofibers, nanowires and carbon nanotubes and their chemical functionalization for distribution to different organs, their solubility, surface, chemical and biological properties, stability and release systems. The toxicity and safety of nanomaterials on human health is also briefly discussed.",nocancer"Federally qualified health center dental program finances: a case study. OBJECTIVES: We analyzed the operation of one Connecticut federally qualified health center (FOHC) dental program with seven delivery sites. We assessed the financial operation of the different delivery sites and contrasted the overall performance of the FOHC with private practices. METHODS: We obtained data from a pretested financial survey instrument, electronic patient visit records, and site visits. To assess clinic productivity, we used two output measures: patient visits and market value of services. For the latter, we estimated the implicit fee of each service provided in patient visits. RESULTS: On average, these clinics were running a modest deficit, mainly due to startup costs of two new clinics. The primary factor that impacted net revenues was low reimbursement rates, including privately insured patients. When FOHC dental revenues were adjusted to market rates, revenues were close to expenses. CONCLUSIONS: FOHC dental clinics are major components of the dental safety net system. This case study suggests that the established clinics use resources as effectively as private practices.",nocancer"The National Asthma Survey--New York State: association of the home environment with current asthma status. OBJECTIVES: The National Asthma Survey--New York State (NYS), a telephone survey of NYS residents, was conducted in 2002-2003 to further understand the burden of asthma among adults and children and to identify health, socioeconomic, behavioral, and environmental factors associated with asthma. METHODS: A total of 1,412 households with at least one member with current asthma and 2,290 control households answered questions about their home environment (e.g., presence of asthma triggers and practices that promote or reduce common asthma triggers). RESULTS; For children younger than 18 years of age, we found statistically significant positive associations between current asthma and the presence of mold (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3, 3.3), air cleaners (AOR = 1.5, 95% CI 1.1, 2.1), dehumidifiers (AOR = 2.0, 95% CI 1.4, 2.7), and humidifiers (AOR = 1.6, 95% CI 1.1, 2.3). For adults, there were statistically significant positive associations with the presence of mold (AOR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.8, 3.4), air cleaners (AOR = 2.2, 95% CI 1.7, 2.8), and humidifiers (AOR = 1.4, 95% CI 1.1, 1.8). There were no statistically significant associations with the presence of cockroaches, pets, or tobacco smoke, while use of a wood-burning stove or fireplace was significantly more prevalent in control homes. CONCLUSIONS: Asthma guidelines emphasize the importance of reducing triggers in the home as part of a multifaceted approach to asthma control. Despite these guidelines, many asthma triggers (specifically, mold) were as prevalent or more so in the homes of New Yorkers with asthma as compared with control households. Public health interventions in NYS should focus on educating households about potential asthma triggers and their sources and teach methods to prevent, reduce, or eliminate them.",nocancer"Tularemia outbreak associated with outdoor exposure along the western side of Utah Lake, Utah, 2007. OBJECTIVES: In 2007, a localized outbreak of tularemia occurred among visitors to a lodge on the western side of Utah Lake, Utah. We assessed risk factors for disease and attempted to identify undiagnosed clinically compatible illnesses. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study by recruiting all people who had visited the lodge on the western side of Utah Lake from June 3 to July 28, 2007. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to a sub-cohort of people who were part of an organized group that had at least one tularemia patient. Questions assessed risk and protective factors and disease symptoms. RESULTS: During the outbreak period, 14 cases of tularemia were reported from five of Utah's 12 health districts. The weekly attack rate ranged from 0 to 2.1/100 lodge visitors from June 3 to July 28. Illness onset dates ranged from June 15 to July 8. The median delay between onset of symptoms and laboratory test for tularemia was 14 days (range: 7-34 days). Cohort study respondents who reported deer-fly bites while at the lodge (adjusted risk ratio [ARR] = 7.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.4, 22.0) and who reported having worn a hat (ARR = 5.6, 95% CI 1.3, 24.6) were more likely to become ill. CONCLUSIONS: This was Utah's second documented deer-fly-associated human tularemia outbreak. People participating in outdoor activities in endemic areas should be aware of disease risks and take precautions. Educational campaigns can aid in earlier disease recognition, reporting, and, consequently, outbreak detection.",nocancer"Varicella seroprevalence in the U.S.: data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999-2004. OBJECTIVE: We estimated the varicella seroprevalence among the U.S. population aged 6-49 years based on retested National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) specimens collected between 1999 and 2004--originally tested using a method unsuitable for detecting vaccine-induced immunity--and compared it with historical estimates. METHODS: We performed a confirmatory test suitable for detecting vaccine-induced immunity on all available specimens from 6- to 19-year-olds who originally tested negative (n = 633), and on 297 randomly selected specimens that had tested positive. Retest results superseded original results for determining seroprevalence. We assessed seroprevalence for the entire sample aged 6-49 years (n = 16,050) by participant demographic characteristics and compared it with historical estimates (NHANES 1988-1994). RESULTS: The percentage of false-negative results for the original test was higher for specimens from younger children (6-11 years of age: 27.5%; 12-19 years of age: 13.3%) and for specimens collected most recently (2001-2004: 26.0%; 1999-2000: 12.6%). The age-adjusted rate of varicella seroprevalence for 1999-2004 was 93.6% for 6- to 19-year-olds and 98.0% for adults aged 20-49 years compared with 90.0% and 98.1%, respectively, for 1988-1994. We found an increase in seropositivity between the survey periods, from 93.2% to 97.2% (p < 0.001) among 12- to 19-year-olds. For children, non-Hispanic black ethnicity and younger age were associated with lower seroprevalence in both survey periods. CONCLUSIONS: Varicella seroprevalence increased with age among children and was uniformly high in the U.S. adult population between 1999 and 2004. The original testing produced false-negative seroprevalence results among children's specimens collected between 1999 and 2004 from 6- to 19-year-olds.",nocancer"Effect of school closure on the incidence of influenza among school-age children in Arizona. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the impact of school closures as a viable intervention in the event of an influenza pandemic. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of scheduled, two-week winter break school closures during the 2004-2008 school years on the occurrence of influenza among children aged 5-17 years in Arizona. RESULTS: We found a consistent pattern of benefit to school-age children during winter school closures when non-school-age children and adults experienced significant increases in influenza incidence, an increase not seen among school-age children. Quantitative analysis showed that school closures may prevent or delay as much as 42% of potential influenza cases among school-age children. In addition, the ratio of illness in school-age children as compared with adults and non-school-age children decreased significantly from before to during the same school closure periods. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides evidence to suggest that school-age children may experience a slowing of influenza transmission during winter school closures compared with those not of school age. Federal, state, and local policy makers may consider these findings in their pandemic influenza and public health emergency preparedness planning efforts.",nocancer"Real-time surveillance for tuberculosis using electronic health record data from an ambulatory practice in eastern Massachusetts. OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records (EHRs) have the potential to improve completeness and timeliness of tuberculosis (TB) surveillance relative to traditional reporting, particularly for culture-negative disease. We report on the development and validation of a TB detection algorithm for EHR data followed by implementation in a live surveillance and reporting system. METHODS: We used structured electronic data from an ambulatory practice in eastern Massachusetts to develop a screening algorithm aimed at achieving 100% sensitivity for confirmed active TB with the highest possible positive predictive value (PPV) for physician-suspected disease. We validated the algorithm in 16 years of retrospective electronic data and then implemented it in a real-time EHR-based surveillance system. We assessed PPV and the completeness of case capture relative to conventional reporting in 18 months of prospective surveillance. RESULTS: The final algorithm required a prescription for pyrazinamide, an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code for TB and prescriptions for two antituberculous medications, or an ICD-9 code for TB and an order for a TB diagnostic test. During validation, this algorithm had a PPV of 84% (95% confidence interval 78, 88) for physician-suspected disease. One-third of confirmed cases were culture-negative. All false-positives were instances of latent TB. In 18 months of prospective EHR-based surveillance with this algorithm, seven additional cases of physician-suspected active TB were detected, including two patients with culture-negative disease. A review of state health department records revealed no cases missed by the algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: Live, prospective TB surveillance using EHR data is feasible and promising.",nocancer"Most pregnant women in California do not receive dental care: findings from a population-based study. OBJECTIVES: We examined the prevalence of dental care during pregnancy and reasons for lack of care. METHODS: Using a population-based survey of 21,732 postpartum women in California during 2002-2007, we calculated prevalence of dental problems, receipt of care, and reasons for non-receipt of care. We used logistic regression to estimate odds of non-receipt of care by maternal characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 65% of women had no dental visit during pregnancy; 52% reported a dental problem prenatally, with 62% of those women not receiving care. After adjustment, factors associated with non-receipt of care included non-European American race/ethnicity, lack of a college degree, lack of private prenatal insurance, no first-trimester prenatal insurance coverage, lower income, language other than English spoken at home, and no usual source of pre-pregnancy medical care. The primary reason stated for non-receipt of dental care was lack of perceived need, followed by financial barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Most pregnant women in this study received insufficient dental care. Odds were elevated not only among the poorest, least educated mothers, but also among those with moderate incomes or some college education. The need for dental care during pregnancy must be promoted widely among both the public and providers, and financial barriers to dental care should be addressed.",nocancer"Trends in oral health by poverty status as measured by Healthy People 2010 objectives. OBJECTIVES: Poverty is a significant social determinant for oral health, yet Healthy People 2010 (HP 2010) does not monitor changes in oral health status by poverty. We assessed recent trends for six HP 2010 oral health objectives by poverty status. METHODS: We used data from the 1988-1994 and 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys to analyze trends for HP 2010 age-specific objectives relating to caries experience, untreated tooth decay, dental sealants, periodontal disease, tooth retention, and complete tooth loss by poverty status. RESULTS: Dental caries significantly increased from 19% to 24% for children aged 2-4 years, but when stratified by poverty, caries only increased significantly for non-poor 2- to 4-year-old children (10% to 15%) (Objective 21-1a). The largest percentage point increase in dental caries was for non-poor boys (9% to 18%). The use of dental sealants continues to grow in the U.S. The largest percentage point increase in sealant use (Objective 21-8) between the two survey periods was for all poor children aged 8 years (3% to 21%). Among adults aged 35-44 years, periodontal disease significantly declined in the U.S. from 22% to 16% (Objective 21-5b) and more adults retained all of their natural teeth (30% to 38%) (Objective 21-3). However, the increase in tooth retention was significant only for non-poor adults, particularly non-poor men (34% to 48%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the oral health status of Americans as measured by HP 2010 objectives mostly showed improvement or remained unchanged between 1998-1994 and 1999-2004. However, some changes in oral health status for some traditionally low-risk groups, such as non-poor children, may be reversing improvements in oral health that have consistently been observed in previous decades. These results suggest that poverty status is an important factor for planning and monitoring future national oral health goals.",nocancer"Racial/ethnic disparities in all-cause mortality in U.S. adults: the effect of allostatic load. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association between a cumulative biological risk or allostatic score and all-cause mortality risk. We used 13,715 records of participants aged 25 years and older from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) linked to the National Death Index. METHODS: We specified all-cause mortality using the underlying cause of death in the death certificate. We calculated time to death from interview date through December 31, 2000, as person-years of follow-up using the NHANES III interview month and year. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) relating all-cause mortality risk for those with an allostatic score of 2 and > or = 3 relative to those with an allostatic score of < or = 1. RESULTS: After controlling for age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and income, mortality rates were 40% (HR = 1.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11, 1.76) and 88% (HR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.56, 2.26) higher for participants with an allostatic score of 2 and > or = 3, respectively, compared with those with a score of < or = 1. The death rate associated with allostatic score for each racial/ethnic group differed with age. CONCLUSIONS: The allostatic score increased the risk of all-cause mortality. Moreover, this increased risk was observed for adults younger than 65 years of age regardless of their race/ethnicity. Thus, allostatic score may be a contributor to premature death in the U.S.",nocancer"The effect of minority status and rural residence on actions to control high blood pressure in the U.S. OBJECTIVE: We examined actions to control high blood pressure (HBP) and health-care provider recommendations for blood pressure control among adults by racial/ethnic group and rural/urban residence. METHODS: We examined data from 45,024 participants with HBP in the 2007 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey. We used multiple logistic regression analyses to assess the independent association between current actions to control HBP and health-care provider recommendations for blood pressure control by race/ethnicity and rural/urban status after accounting for confounders. RESULTS: Black people, regardless of rural or urban residence, were more likely to report reducing salt and alcohol intake, changing eating habits, and taking medications than both white urban and white rural adults. Black people, regardless of rural or urban status, were more likely to be advised to cut down on salt, reduce alcohol use, and change eating habits. Black rural adults were also more likely to report being advised to take medications than white urban adults, while white rural adults were less likely to be advised to exercise than white urban adults. CONCLUSIONS: Race/ethnicity and rural/urban status have a differential effect on actions to control HBP and provider advice to control HBP.",nocancer"Easier said than done: behavioral conflicts in following social-distancing recommendations for influenza prevention. Preventing transmission of H1N1 and other infectious diseases can require individuals to change behaviors, but recommendations to change behavior can run counter to other powerful influences. For example, instructions to not shake hands or avoid certain public gatherings can run counter to substantial social pressures to shake hands or be in attendance. These behavioral conflicts are illustrated with an experience of the relative ineffectiveness of voluntary recommendations, which highlights the importance of considering these social pressures when determining what recommendations to make and how to make them. An analysis of how social pressures influence behaviors relevant to preventing disease transmission can aid public health officials in considering how to make effective recommendations concerning H1N1 and other infectious disease situations.",nocancer"Overlap syndrome: autoimmune hepatitis with primary biliary cirrhosis. ""Overlap syndrome"" is used to describe variant forms of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) which present with characteristics of AIH and primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) or primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Patients with overlap syndromes present with both hepatitic and cholestatic serum liver tests and have histological features of AIH and PBC or PSC. AIH-PBC is the most common form of overlap syndrome, affecting almost 10% of adults with AIH or PBC. Transitions from PBC to AIH-PBC overlap syndrome have also been reported. Overlap syndromes show a progressive course without treatment, and therapy is empiric. Ursodeoxycholic acid is usually combined with immunosuppressive therapy but end-stage disease requires liver transplantation. We report a case of AIH/PBC overlap with relevant discussion of literature.",nocancer"Diabetes mellitus and renal tubular acidosis in primary Sjogren's syndrome. Sjogren's syndrome is an autoimmune disease with multisystem involvement characterised by lymphocytic infiltration of exocrine glands resulting in keratoconjunctivitis sicca, xerostomia and bilateral parotid gland enlargement.

Stroke is a serious health problem and is chiefly a disorder of the elderly population. Several modifiable and non modifiable risk factors have been studied. The association of sleep disorders and stroke is exciting. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) which is now considered a systemic disease significantly increases the risk of stroke and death from any cause and the increase is independent of other risk factors including hypertension. There is high prevalence of OSA in the elderly. OSA affects the cerebral hemodynamics adversely. There appears to be a bi-directional relation between sleep disordered breathing(SDB) and cerebrovascular accidents. Strokes can themselves generate SDB. The presence of OSA in stroke patients is associated with poor outcome. Cyclical hypoxia and sympathetic stimulation has deleterious effects on cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and metabolic functions. The effects are particularly important in existing ischemic brain injury. Use of continuous positive pressure in OSA patients is rewarding. We propose that feeding through Ryle's tube may compromise with the patency of pharynx during sleep times and therefore this must be considered in management guidelines for stroke.",nocancer"Obstructive sleep apnoea: a clinical review. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common medical disorder associated with considerable morbidity and is being recognized and diagnosed with increasing frequency. Patients with OSA are frequently overweight and usually present with longstanding history of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness along with accompanying obesity. The diagnosis is established with Polysomnography (PSG), although the decision as to who should be sent to a sleep laboratory must be individualised, especially for those patients whose main complaint is snoring. The most important factor in the pathogenesis of OSA is a narrow and floppy pharyngeal airway. Of the several treatment modalities which are available presently, the most successful is the application of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep.",nocancer
